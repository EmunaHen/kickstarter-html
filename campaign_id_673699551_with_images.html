Even harder.</span></p><p>Whether you're a student juggling classes, a busy professional, or a parent managing a household — making meals from scratch every single day is exhausting.</p><ul>
<li><span class="text-italic">Now imagine living in a dorm or apartment building and not even knowing the person next door.</span></li>
<li><span class="text-italic">Imagine cooking a little extra food, but throwing it away because you didn’t know who to offer it to.</span></li>
<li><span class="text-italic">Imagine being hungry, but holding back from asking because it feels awkward, even shameful.</span></li>
</ul><p><span class="bold">That’s the problem. </span><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">Not the lack of food — but the lack of connection.</span></span></p><ul>
<li><span class="text-italic">What if the person cooking next door could simply make one extra portion? </span></li>

<p>We even tried wearing boards around campus to break the ice and spark conversations. It worked — but let’s be honest, not everyone can walk around like this when they need a meal. With FoodBurp, you don’t have to ask. One tap, and your surroundings know. No questions. No shame. Just help, naturally.</p><p><span class="bold">2.</span> <span class="bold">Unused Meal Swipes, Untapped Potential</span></p><p>Many universities in the U.S. offer <span class="bold">meal swipes</span> — prepaid credits that students use to get food at on-campus dining halls. But here’s the problem: students often don’t use all of them.</p><p>Between busy schedules, skipped meals, or eating off-campus, <span class="bold">thousands of students waste 2–3 meal swipes every week</span>. That’s not just lost food — it’s <span class="bold">hundreds of thousands of dollars</span> thrown away each semester.</p><ul><li>Even President Biden called out the growing issue of student meal plan waste — urging universities to refund unused swipe balances back to students. But the response? Most campuses gave students the <span class="text-italic">option to donate</span> their swipes. No real system. No real change.<br/><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">FoodBurp bridges that gap — </span></span>and built a <span class="bold">win-win solution</span>.</li></ul><p><span class="bold">3.</span> <span class="bold">Extra Food, No One to Share It With</span><br/>Cooking a little extra is easy.

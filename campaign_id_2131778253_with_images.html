Visitors can register and connect with others in various forms.</p><p>It’s not the first, nor the last of its kind competing on the online market.</p><p>It carries a unique twist in design and functionality, while familiar to use for skilled users.</p><p>Like other platforms in their time, Glamgenius strides to enter the worldwide market, to start receiving registrations and to maintain a stable user base that is ever growing.</p><p>Our initial goal will be to develop a stable version for the web at launch. Following the launch, the next goal is producing an advanced version that people will download on their devices.</p><p>Registered members will be able to use the following features :</p><p>- connect with other users ( connect with their social group, find new people from around the world and create a user base )</p><p>- chat ( communicate using text, image or video )</p><p>- create and share content ( post various news from their local area, interesting knowledge facts, or new ideas for others to read and interact with )</p><p>- live streaming ( share live video content with their user base )</p><p>- advertise and sell products ( create product articles, share them with their user base, generate sales, or pay to promote products outside their user base )</p><p>- receive earnings ( become Partners and get earnings by creating work to enrich the platform’s content, raise its popularity and increase its user base )</p><p>We operate using the following system :</p><p>The platform is developed and maintained by the company. Company details:</p><p>What is Money Ltd.</p><p>Company registration number: 13416876</p><p>Incorporated in the United Kingdom and operating since 2021</p><p>How it works:</p><p>Users create content while other users consume content.</p><p>The revenue is generated from paid advertisements, content promotions or product sales fees.</p><p>Donors are regarded as coFounders</p><p>    ( minimum pledge amount required )</p><p>Every registered user that produces work on the platform is regarded as a Partner</p><p>    ( minimum level of work required )</p><p>Users that don’t produce work are regarded as consumers and are not included in the earnings sharing plan.</p><p>co-Founders don’t receive stock in the company, they receive contract guarantees.</p><p>1.0 - The minimum pledge amount required is 999$. By pledging this amount, you will be qualified as a coFounder and this will guarantee the highest level of revenue share available. On top of this, their names / usernames will be engraved in the official founding memorium, detailing the work and effort put in by its developers, as well as the financial contributions of those who brought this project to life, similar to how a building may use a plaque in public view to remember its architects, designers, and financiers.</p><p>You do not earn more revenue share if you pledge more, but if you do pledge more, you will speed up the development of the platform, and pave the way to a grandiose campaign at launch, as well as contributing to raise the capital power to compete further with the giants that are already running on the market.</p><p>1.1 - Any individual crowdfunding amount that doesn’t reach the minimum required amount of 999$ will receive a special account with us, carrying a digital honor plaque, visible on their profile, and additional functionality available to their accounts first, with priority to other users.</p><p>Users that are interested in producing work for the platform are able to join at any time, after the launch.</p><p>After the expense of maintenance and development as well as taxes are covered, the remaining profit revenue is distributed among coFounders on a weekly or monthly basis, with regard to their pledge, or, if non-donor, the volume and quality of work produced as well as the impact that their content has on user attraction, user interaction, and ad revenue or sales.</p><p>Partners are incentivised to produce quality work, thereby directing the platform name and status towards the wider scene rather than a minority.</p><p>As a general rule, the larger and more diverse the audience, the bigger the profits.</p><p>In other words, its potential to succeed early on is likely to be high.</p><p>To recap, this platform is aiming at connecting users from around the world to communicate, create &amp; consume content, spread information, and to grow financially in parallel with the platform through its shared revenue plan.</p><p>A self sustaining, personal revenue generating, information network.</p><p>Besides its unique design and functionality, the platform distinguishes itself from the rest through the opportunities for earnings offered to the real people from around the world.</p><p>Literally, every person in the world can earn money on the platform, equally.</p><p>The twist here is that there is no single coFounder or Partner that earns considerably more than the other.</p><p>Here is the design of the platform as well as the functionality, described in detail:</p><p>The visitors are greeted by a sign in and registration area.</p><p>Links towards other areas like terms and conditions, privacy and cookies policy, as well as a blog where users can read news related to the platform can be found at the footer.</p><p>Here, there is also a contact section that handles user inquiries.</p><p>These links are available to users all through the platform navigation.</p><p>At the top of the greeting area, there is a language module to switch to another language.</p><p>After registering, the users can sign in to the platform to access further functionality.</p><p>Next, they are further greeted by the main area, where they can find ( from top to bottom )</p><p>- a horizontal row of categories to choose from.</p><p>- a horizontal row of profiles to choose from</p><p>- and a vertical strip of articles, posts, shared images and videos, polls and livestreams</p><p>Strip of categories</p><p>Selecting a category will switch the content of the main area with the content of that type.</p><p>Selecting Arts, for example, will bring up Arts-related content to view and interact with.</p><p>The search button is positioned at the top left and a search strip slides out towards the right so that users can type in their search query.</p><p>The search feature is still being developed.</p><p>Strip of profiles</p><p>Further, the next row holds profiles of users from the visitors’ user base. Visitors will be able to connect with these profiles, view their bio, chat with them, as well as view and interact with their content.</p><p>At the left of the profiles row, there is a button that refreshes the list of profiles in a random arrangement. New profiles that the users haven’t connected with are added, selected based on each user’s interests.</p><p>A user interested in sports will receive profiles that are interested in the same activity, as well as other random profiles in between.</p><p>View Profile</p><p>Clicking on a profile will reveal the profile view mode.</p><p>The following design is used for the profile page. A white globe frame encases their profile photo, with their displayname shown underneath.</p><p>Bio</p><p>Next, the menu items are listed, starting with Bio, where the users can read the bio info of that profile.</p><p>Favs</p><p>Then, the Favorites, or Favs, where the users can view the Favorites count of that profile, view the common Favorites, as well as be able to add them to their Favorites list.</p><p>Chat</p><p>Further, there’s the chat button that reveals a direct chat window with 2 chat modes available, private ( AvaChat ) and not private ( Basic ).</p><p>The difference between private and not private is that for the private chat, there’s a guarantee that the chat data is not saved or analysed by the platform. Instead, the data is stored locally on the users’ device browser.</p><p>It still travels through our servers in order to reach the other user’s device but it isn’t used by the system for other purposes.</p><p>The user will communicate through text, images, videos, and links, with other users.</p><p>Profile Content</p><p>Next, there is the content articles strip, displayed as horizontal columns on a vertical roll with minimal data included, just a small image and title.</p><p>If the users are viewing their own profile, they can find a button at the far left of the article that reveals functionality regarding pinning, promoting, editing or removing the article.</p><p>Clicking on a column ( article ) will bring up the article view mode that is described further below.</p><p>Similarly, with their own profile in view, a create content button would also be displayed just above the content articles to navigate towards content creation.</p><p>Here, the users can choose from Stories, Streams, or Store categories to create content, add text, images, videos, opinion polls, create live stream or add products for sale.</p><p>Depending on the privacy settings of the other user, adding the profile to favorites may be required to enable the previous two functions ( chat, view articles )</p><p>While in private mode, a connection is required, but once this is made, the user’s content will be available to the other users and vice versa.</p><p>While in public mode, the content and chat will be available to access without a connection.</p><p>Side panel</p><p>Below the refresh button lies the side panel link, that slides out from the left side of the window, and where users are able to edit their bio information, their account type, their profile photo, as well as accessing settings, viewing earnings and work statistics and performance.</p><p>The links related to the conditions, policies, blog and contact are also available here.</p><p>Roll of Content</p><p>Next, we have the content section which features a flat roll of articles for the user to choose from. These are displayed as cards, on a vertical roll, and hold summary information.</p><p>Each article is composed of title, intro paragraph, mini photo, a mini title, and the main article content text.</p><p>Only available to desktop or laptop devices, the users can glance at a background of stars while scrolling through the articles, just like we are able to view in the sky, at night, in real life.</p><p>Clicking on an article will bring up the article view mode. Here, there is the full article description on a scrollable flat roll, the image, the intro paragraph and the mini title. The users are also able to view the author profile with the possibility to add them as a favorite.</p><p>Clicking on an image post will bring up the image view mode, with the author profile at the top, the photo description and hash tags / keywords, as well as a row reserved for likes, comments, and shares, at the bottom.</p><p>Clicking on the comments will reveal the comments section where the user can read and comment regarding that content or topic.</p><p>The comments area is still being developed.</p><p>Clicking on a video post will bring up the video view mode, and start playing the video. There is also a like, comment and share section here.</p><p>The video area is still being developed.</p><p>Clicking on a stream post, will pop up the stream view mode, which is also in development.</p><p>Creating content</p><p>This is still in development but it will feature:</p><p>creating articles</p><p>creating simple posts</p><p>creating opinion polls</p><p>adding images</p><p>adding videos</p><p>creating live streams</p><p>adding products for sale</p><p>The user will be able to promote their articles and their products if this is what they need.</p><p>Since the platform is still in the development stage, the version at launch will see an optimisation of these features to provide a better user experience.</p><p>Now, to differentiate this project from others that just promise and don’t deliver, we present the platform while still in the development stage.

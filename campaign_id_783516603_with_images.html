Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.”</span></h4><p>You have heard it before, and maybe you have thought it yourself: <span class="text-italic">'there is no point thinking about what I can do as an individual because the fault is on corporations and institutions, people alone cannot make a difference, we just have to wait for regulators and industries to change.'  </span></p><p>While it is tempting to give into this nihilism, systemic change only comes about through the dedication of regular people making lots of little changes. That doesn't discount the overwhelming need to governments and corporations to take accountability, but it does mean that if we have power that also can't be overlooked and discounted. When we have the opportunity to do something good, we are morally obligated to do it, and sometimes we just need the tools to do so, that is what Conscious is here for. </p><p>We get it, it is hard to know what to do, and hard not to feel hopeless, but we are here to help. </p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:-What-is-Conscious-">
<span class="bold">What is </span><span>Conscious</span><span class="bold">?</span>
</h3><p>In January 2023, we founded <span class="text-italic">Conscious!,</span> a startup that aims to make climate-conscious purchasing available and affordable to everyone. We are developing an app that allows users to scan a product’s barcode, see its carbon footprint and sustainability metrics, and explore a list of third-party vetted, lower-carbon alternatives. After a purchase on a low Carbon Alternative, users will receive cash back for sustainable purchases. </p><p>To encourage community, users will also be able to compete with their friends in local challenges. We have a database of sustainable alternatives to everyday products that users can search through to find the perfect product. It is designed to decrease your consumption, and find you long-lasting, planet friendly alternatives to your favorite products. We started this business because we believe that together we can create a new standard for the product market that values what regular people value; a safe and healthy environment.  </p><p>When change seems slow, our tools allow consumers to hold companies accountable  by making it easy to put their money behind their values. We know that every dollar is a vote for the kind of future we will have, and we want everyone to have well-informed votes. </p><p>Here is a quick video of us demoing our app to our friends at the library: </p>
<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:How-it-Started-">How it Started,</h3><p>After years of anxiety about climate change, in the midst of a slow sinking into despair and afternoon sessions in university-mandated climate and environmental and climate sciences group therapy, Hannah had an epiphany at her sister's wedding: No bullshit, it is time to forget the temptation to focus on burning the old world, after all that smoke is bad for the environment anyway. It is time to roll up my sleeves and build a better world, and find what small part I can play in imaging a better world and doing the work to realize it. </p><p>Frances was completely consumed with ‘eco-anxiety’. Learning about climate change often feels heartbreaking, frightening, and hopeless. Frances was plagued by the Apple News app. When she woke up, when she finished an assignment, and when she went to sleep, she scrolled straight to the ‘Climate Change’ section of the app. Apple News never failed to bring her down. Every hopeful story was accompanied by 10 bad ones. A new drilling project is approved, the Environmental Protection Agency is made powerless, or an oil spill devastates wildlife. Terrified of worldwide inaction, she went from sincerely doubting she could do anything, to knowing that she could not do anything else but dedicate her life to the planet. </p><p>Ishita joined the team in the spring of 2024. Since joining, Ishita has been an enormous asset to the team. It is through the combination of our collective passion, diverse skill sets and love for each other that has made Conscious a growing start up since 2023.</p><p>Learn more about the founders of Conscious here: </p>
<p>Frances and Hannah met in a climate research group led by Dr. Jeffery Coles. Frances and Hannah instantly became close. We bonded over our attempts to live as sustainably as possible, but we both were frustrated by how hard it was to agonize over every little purchase without knowing what our impact on the planet was. Obviously, we all have to purchase necessities, but in an economy where most companies disregard the environmental in pursuit of profit, its hard to know which companies are being sincere about their environmental commitments. The kind of eco-guilt that haunted them everyday, gnawed away at them, and made them feel powerless. We noticed that most of our friends felt the same kind of despair and it often turned into a sense of nihilism. So under the direction of Dr. Jeffery Coles, Frances and Hannah got busy. </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Ishita (left) Hannah (middle) Frances (right) after winning the largest prize for student climate innovation in Utah" data-id="48986901">

<span>Frances and Hannah after a successful grant pitch</span><p>After fundraising from <span>grants,</span>combinators and other sources, we are so close to launching our product. We are excited to see where we can take it from here. </p><p>We are here to make a difference, and we are sticking around. The work that we do  collectively in this moment will echo in the decades to come, and our planet. After all, we are in this together. </p><p><span class="bold">We will leave you with this poem by </span><span>Kyle Gaunte</span><span class="bold"> to describe how we feel in response to climate change and what we can do together:</span></p><p>Upon stumbling, by chance, upon a man, waist-deep in quicksand, I need a second to process. After all, this is fiction made flesh; it’s like a cartoon, like going to the zoo and seeing a mermaid. So my first response, naturally, is to tell him:</p><p><span class="text-italic">Hey, um, I’m pretty sure that I read somewhere that quicksand isn’t actually dangerous, that this idea of a patch of sandy water sucking a person down into oblivion is just a tall tale, a trope to build tension in early 1960s westerns. In real life, yeah, I mean, you can get caught in some mud, but it’s not really that hard to get out. So are you sure you’re sinking in quicksand?</span></p><p>He sinks. My words don’t seem to have any effect. So being an open-minded, progressive individual, I reevaluate. Maybe quicksand is real. So what now?</p><p>My second response upon stumbling, by chance, upon a man, chest deep in quicksand is, before I actually do anything, to make sure that I have the whole picture. I mean, what was this guy doing out here in the jungle all alone? Did he step into that quicksand on purpose? Was he asking for it? Does he have a criminal record? Maybe I should wait until all the facts come in.</p><p>He sinks. And again, being an open-minded, progressive individual, I decide to give him the benefit of the doubt, at least for now. I want to <span class="text-italic">help</span>.</p><p>So my third response upon stumbling, by chance, upon a man, neck deep in quicksand is, obviously, to recite a poem. To throw some positive energy his way. To describe, out loud, just how heavy my heart is. I take a piece of paper out of my backpack, and with a pen, I write “quicksand is bad and I am an ALLY to those who fall in it.” I pin that piece of paper to my chest. I take out my phone and I tweet “when are we going to wake up? #quicksand.”</p><p>He sinks. And being an open-minded, progressive individual, I decide that this isn’t enough, that we, as a society, need to address the root causes of people sinking in quicksand. So my fourth response upon stumbling, by chance, upon a man, forehead-deep in quicksand, is to take a moment to acknowledge my privilege as someone who is <span class="text-italic">not</span> sinking in quicksand. I vow to take a class, to be more mindful of how I navigate the world.</p><p>He sinks. And being an open-minded, progressive individual, I decide that the time for words has passed; now is the time for action. So my fifth response upon stumbling, by chance, upon a man, disappeared into quicksand, is… is…</p><p>We can’t allow ourselves to forget what happened here. I know that we need to do something, to put up a sign, to educate people, to build a bridge over this patch of quicksand. I just don’t have any wood. I just have this backpack full of paper and pens and rope; what can one person do?</p><p>I imagine my lungs filling with mud. Black earth. Brown water. The hike back to my hotel will be full of reflection. I offer my thoughts, and my prayers. It is the least I can do.</p><p><span class="bold">The Conscious Team loves you </span></p><p><br/> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt4"><div class="pt4" id="project-budget"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm"><h2 class="normal mb4">Project budget</h2><div class="w100p flex-column"><div class="flex relative justify-center w100p border border-grey-400 bg-grey-100"><div class="w100p flex-column justify-center pl2 pb4 pr2 pl10-sm pr10-sm"><div class="relative flex justify-center items-center h50"><svg height="250" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMid" viewbox="0 0 250 250" width="250"><g transform="translate(125, 125) scale(2.5, 2.5)"><defs><pattern height="1" id="bg1" patternunits="objectBoundingBox" width="1"><image class="bgimage" height="160" href="https://i.kickstarter.com/xglb1yux-hatch_light_green_pattern_overlays_20190901.png?fit=scale-down&amp;origin=static&amp;width=1000&amp;sig=clgJlzhY3k416hIJWrLOR2MdAEuRyBIYLy5Q4Y0qGuE%3D" width="160" x="0" y="0"/></pattern><pattern height="1" id="bg2" patternunits="objectBoundingBox" width="1"><image class="bgimage" height="160" href="https://i.kickstarter.com/qm5rth84-dot_line_white_2_pattern_overlays_20190901.png?origin=static&amp;sig=X4u8yLPJQSLFYyFAWhfks%2Bb0l7JvccL9Ns4mZ%2BdcX%2Fs%3D" width="160" x="0" y="0"/></pattern><pattern height="1" id="bg3" patternunits="objectBoundingBox" width="1"><image class="bgimage" height="160" href="https://i.kickstarter.com/2pgrzep-scattered_dots_black_pattern_overlays_20190901.png?fit=scale-down&amp;origin=static&amp;width=1000&amp;sig=7dYAvrHvJlUMrHNcRby2NfD16BbES28QnocyMYhS%2BjU%3D" width="160" x="0" y="0"/></pattern><pattern height="1" id="bg4" patternunits="objectBoundingBox" width="1"><image class="bgimage" height="160" href="https://i.kickstarter.com/l9o3ber7-grid_dark_green_pattern_overlays_20190901.png?fit=scale-down&amp;origin=static&amp;width=1000&amp;sig=w1sAH2Z8b0%2Bm44c8oN%2BES4hwspBpkhrrhc1YpFJSPyQ%3D" width="160" x="0" y="0"/></pattern><pattern height="1" id="bg5" patternunits="objectBoundingBox" width="1"><image class="bgimage" height="160" href="https://i.kickstarter.com/v0js8b2e-dot_line_white_pattern_overlays_20190901.png?fit=scale-down&amp;origin=static&amp;width=1000&amp;sig=j1%2Biz4vH2TtOn5EX0sEl2Xque0oEBcJupM5qVbNe8CM%3D" width="160" x="0" y="0"/></pattern></defs><path class="innerArc innerArc0" d="M1.2748087586060648,-43.7814442729906A43.8,43.8,0,1,1,-40.48059220876406,-16.726077078255695L-32.398832074391116,-13.107943401441927A34.949999999999996,34.949999999999996,0,1,0,1.2748087586060675,-34.92674280016648Z" fill="#059968" style="opacity: 1;

<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:A-Revolutionary-Cocktail-Shaker">A Revolutionary Cocktail Shaker</h3><p>Hi Backers, Bartenders, Mixologists, and Bar Owners!</p><p>GET READY for a new generation of cocktail shakers! Introducing a revolutionary cocktail shaker designed for single-handed quick, efficient and simple use.  It's the first single-handed cocktail shaker tin in the world.  </p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:The-Purpose-For-You-by-one-of-You-">The Purpose.  For You by one of You!</h3><p>This has turned into a passion project.  I've been bartending for 15 years.  People always ask me, "when are you going to hang up your shakers?" lol.  But I've always loved bartending, and I still do.  It was never my plan to invent something, let alone an invention for bartending.  But I'm really glad I did.  I want Speed Tin to actually help people. I want it to help bartenders make more tips, make them faster, and make their job easier. I want it to help bar owners increase revenue.  I want bar patrons to be happy getting their cocktail faster.  I also want Speed Tin to help home bartenders just by making it easier to shake and pour a cocktail after a long hard day at work. Or mocktail ;). I'm really grateful that I now have the opportunity to give back to a community that I've been so involved with and truly love.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Our-Patented-Design-in-Collaboration-with-JonCon-Creative-Works-">Our Patented Design in Collaboration with JonCon Creative Works </h3><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:The-Single-handed-Concept">The Single-handed Concept</h4><p>I wanted to design the shaker so that it would be fast, simple and save the bartender from having to do extra work. The idea had to be for single-handed use, which has never been done before.  It needed to eliminate a step.  It needed to make shaking and serving easier.  One of the biggest pain points for any bartender is having to separate shaker tins or the frozen cap at the top.  I also knew the design had to be something even beginner bartenders could easily use.  </p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Built-in-Strainer-">Built-in Strainer </h4><p>Having a built-in strainer ensures no ice cubes will ever end up in your cocktails.  The built-in strainer can also hold back other ingredients.  With a built-in strainer, you eliminate having to purchase and utilize another bartending tool.  This also means one less thing to rinse, clean or put away.  Sometimes an actual strainer can be difficult to find.<br/> </p><p><span class="bold">Convenience</span>: It eliminates the need for a separate straining tool, simplifying the cocktail-making process and allowing for a quicker pour.</p><p><span class="bold">Consistency</span>: A built-in strainer helps ensure that only the desired liquid (the cocktail) flows into the glass, while ice and other ingredients remain in the shaker.</p><p><span class="bold">Less Mess</span>: It reduces spillage and makes for a cleaner pouring experience, minimizing the mess often associated with shaking and straining cocktails.</p><p><span class="bold">Portability</span>: With a strainer integrated into the shaker, it's more practical for mobile use, such as at parties or during travel, as there's one less item to carry.</p><p><span class="bold">Space-saving</span>: It takes up less space in your bar or kitchen, particularly useful in smaller setups where storage is a concern.</p><p>Overall, a built-in strainer enhances the efficiency and ease of preparing cocktails, making it a valuable feature for both novice and experienced mixologists.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:The-Pull-Sled-Spring-loaded-with-an-Easy-Pull-back">The Pull Sled.  Spring-loaded with an Easy Pull-back</h4><p>The pull-back mechanism utilizes a spring, which is useful in allowing the bartender to control the size of the opening.  If the bartender were pouring shots or shooters, they may only pull back slightly. But when pouring a martini, a bartender can pull back all the way, allowing maximum flow.  The spring allows the mechanism to close after being let go, which will save the bartender the step of having to close the opening themselves.  </p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Flow-Patterns">Flow Patterns</h4><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="48490343">

We have spent months prototyping and testing our product in some of the busiest settings to ensure that it can survive drops, bangs, cleaning, and general rough treatment of a tool intended to produce hundreds of drinks per shift. 

Specifically to maximizing the life of Speetin are as follows:

The major components that comprise the body and moving components are made of 304 stainless steel with a substantially thicker gauge than existing bar tins.
 
All components subject to wear and tear such the gaskets and springs are easily serviced and replaced to extend the life of the Speedtin.

The grips are made to be easily removed and replaced with different styles to better suit different users' serving style.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Reusability and recyclability</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">As mentioned the grips are replaceable to better suit other users. As we expect Speedtin to outlast the tenure of most bartenders

With exception to gaskets which constitute a very small amount of material, all major components of Speedtin are easily separated and recycled.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Sustainable materials</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">The steel and plastics used in the majority of Speedtin's components come from recycled or partially recycled stock and are designed to last a lifetime</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Environmentally friendly factories</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">Packaging is manufactured in facilities that follow environmentally responsible practices, focusing on waste reduction and energy efficiency.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span>Questions about this project? </span><span class="bold link-blue type-16">Check out the FAQ</span></div></div><div id="report-this-project"><span class="kds-button kds-button">Report this project to Kickstarter</span></div></div>

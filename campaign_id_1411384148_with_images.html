Building a platform as personal and emotionally resonant as Eterna comes with both technical and ethical responsibilities. Here’s how we’re approaching them with care, transparency, and intentional safeguards.

🧠 AI Accuracy and Training

Creating an Echo that feels authentic takes time. We require users to complete a guided onboarding process so their Echo learns to speak in their unique voice and tone. We’re continually refining this system to balance realism with respectful boundaries.

📈 Scaling Responsibly

To ensure smooth performance at launch, we’re starting with rate-limited Echo interactions (e.g., a few chats per day). As our infrastructure scales — and with support from stretch goals — we’ll gradually expand this capacity.

🔐 Data Privacy and Ownership

Eterna is fully GDPR-compliant. All data is encrypted, exportable, and under user control. No Echo data will ever be used to train third-party AI models without opt-in. Legacy control settings ensure family access is always permission-based.

🧭 Ethical Use &amp; Grief Support

Because Eterna deals with life, loss, and memory, we’ve created a comprehensive Ethical Guidelines Framework that includes:
	•	Grief Mode: A compassionate interaction layer that allows families to gradually access Echoes after death. Features include daily chat limits, memory-only views, and emotionally safe response filters.
	•	Child Access Controls: Under-12 users receive simplified, age-appropriate responses, with guardian-approved access only.
	•	Legacy Timing Options: Echo creators can choose when and how their digital self becomes accessible after they pass — from instant access to time delays or event-triggered availability (e.g. birthdays).
	•	Safeguards on Misuse: Echoes cannot be used in legal disputes, for impersonation, or in ways that undermine informed consent.

We’ve worked with grief advisors, child psychologists, and ethical AI researchers to ensure Eterna supports remembrance while respecting emotional wellbeing.

🧪 Voice &amp; Face Replication (Future Versions)

We are committed to releasing future features (voice and facial animation) only after thorough emotional safety testing. All replications will be opt-in, reviewed with an ethics advisory group, and designed with dignity in mind.

📢 Ongoing Transparency

We will publish regular updates, including an open ethics review summary and invite backers into our development discussions via Discord and AMAs. 

To ensure long-term sustainability and a high-quality experience for all users, we’ll begin with a lower interaction limit—even for paying members—to responsibly manage server and AI processing costs. As we grow and scale our infrastructure, we plan to increase these limits in stages, delivering greater value and flexibility over time.

Eterna isn’t just a product — it’s a platform of trust.</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Use of AI</h2></div><div class="border-bottom mb2"><h3 class="normal type-18 mt5">I plan to use AI-generated content in my project.</h3><h4 class="bold lh4" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What parts of your project will use AI generated content? Please be as specific as possible.</h4><p class="border-left border-create-700 border-left5px pl3">Use of AI

Yes, Eterna uses AI as a core part of the experience — but always with human purpose, ethical guardrails, and creative intent at the centre.

Here’s how AI is used in this project:
	•	🧠 Echo Construction: We use large language models to help simulate a user’s communication style and generate responses from their digital Echo.
	•	🔊 (Future) Voice Replication: In Version 2, we’ll offer optional voice cloning based on user-recorded input, using ethical, consent-first voice AI tools.
	•	🖼 (Future) Face Replication: Version 3 will include optional avatar generation using uploaded photos, developed under strict emotional safety testing and consent guidelines.
	•	🎨 Page Design Support: Some design layouts and copywriting have been AI-assisted — always guided by human authors and reviewed for clarity and tone.

Our Commitments:
	•	We do not train AI models on user content without explicit opt-in.
	•	All Echo creation is user-initiated and shaped by real memories, not automated impersonation.
	•	We are building ethically, not exploitatively — the AI exists to support real human legacies, not replace them.

Eterna is built with AI, but always in service of human memory, identity, and love.</p><h4 class="bold lh4" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Do you have the consent of owners of the works that were (or will be) used to produce the AI generated portion of your projects? Please explain.</h4><p class="border-left border-create-700 border-left5px pl3">Consent for AI Training and Use of Works

Yes. Eterna only uses AI models built on data where proper usage rights and ethical sourcing are confirmed.
	•	We do not train any AI models using Kickstarter backer data, user-submitted memories, or personal content without explicit opt-in consent.
	•	All AI-generated Echoes are based solely on user-provided input during onboarding — such as written memories, traits, and guided prompts. This content is used only for that user’s Echo, not to improve or retrain the underlying model.
	•	For Public Echoes (e.g., Socrates, Lincoln, Marie Curie), we work from public domain texts and historical references, written by our team, not scraped or cloned from private sources.
	•	We are committed to ethical AI development — no content is used without permission or licensing where applicable.

In short: every AI-generated portion of this project is either based on public domain material, licensed tools, or user-owned content shared with informed consent.</p></div><div class="mt5"><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about AI policy on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-commitments" id="environmentalCommitments"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Environmental commitments</h2><span><span class="ksr-green-700">Visit our Environmental Resources Center</span> to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.</span></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Something else</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">� Environmental Commitments

Eterna is a digital platform built to preserve stories — not consume resources. While our environmental footprint is naturally smaller than physical products, we still take our responsibility to the planet seriously.

♻️ Minimal Physical Waste
	•	Our core offering is 100% digital — no shipping, no packaging, and no carbon-intensive production.
	•	Physical add-ons (like journals or USB drives) are optional, limited in volume, and sourced from eco-conscious suppliers.

☁️ Sustainable Hosting &amp; Infrastructure
	•	We’re selecting hosting providers with net-zero commitments and green data centre policies (e.g. Google Cloud or AWS sustainability tier).
	•	Echo storage and compute loads are designed to scale efficiently — reducing excess server strain and energy use.

� Digital-First Legacy = Low Impact
	•	By choosing Eterna, you’re replacing physical heirlooms, DVDs, and printed media with a single lightweight digital archive.
	•	Long-term memory preservation doesn’t require ongoing physical maintenance, reducing long-run resource waste.

� Future Commitments
	•	We plan to offset the energy cost of long-term data storage by supporting verified carbon offset projects.
	•	Our printed rewards (if any) will use recycled paper and minimal packaging by default.

Eterna is about preserving what matters — and that includes the planet future generations will inherit.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span>Questions about this project? </span><span class="bold link-blue type-16">Check out the FAQ</span></div></div><div id="report-this-project"><span class="kds-button kds-button">Report this project to Kickstarter</span></div></div>

Our mission is to bring the art and science of animatronics to makers of all ages, backgrounds, and skill levels through creative, hands-on learning. That’s why we're excited to introduce a project near and dear to our hearts: the <span class="bold">Animatronic Songbird Mini STEM/STEAM Build Kits.</span></p><p>Inspired by the classic charm and storytelling techniques of early theme park tiki bird animatronics, the Animatronic Songbird Mini was developed for educational spaces but is designed to allow makers of all levels to bring their very own animatronic character to life. Now, anyone can explore creativity, develop technical skills, and experience the wonder of animatronics from the comfort of their own home or classroom!</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Proven-Success-in-Inspiring-Young-Minds"><span class="bold">Proven Success in Inspiring Young Minds</span></h3><p>We’ve prototyped and piloted this kit in schools across the country, and the results speak for themselves. At our “Bird Camps” students light up as they assemble their birds, give each one a unique personality, and create the illusion of life.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Where-Curiosity-Comes-to-life-Hear-from-the-students">Where Curiosity Comes to life: Hear from the students</h3>
<p>The Animatronic Songbird Mini Kit was designed to bring STEAM education to the forefront of a hands-on building experience. Along the way, the program has led to some unexpected and exciting outcomes. Students who are often unengaged in traditional classroom settings use their Animatronic Songbird Mini as a new outlet for self-expression. The result is more engaged learners at the powerful intersection of STEAM education and social-emotional learning.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:From-the-classroom-to-the-Workshop-What-teachers-are-saying">From the classroom to the Workshop: What teachers are saying</h3>
<p>Teachers and parents have shared how this hands-on experience builds confidence, fosters teamwork, and sparks a lasting love for innovation. Through the creative journey of putting together and finishing their very own animatronic character, makers gain valuable skills in engineering, programming, voice acting, and the arts. The process culminates in a fully programmed animatronic performance. This kit provides a meaningful, hands-on experience that inspires curiosity, celebrates individuality, and builds a true sense of accomplishment.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:From-Working-Prototype-to-a-Fully-Realized-Product"><span class="bold">From Working Prototype to a Fully Realized Product</span></h3><p><span class="bold">What’s New in This Version?</span></p><p>Thanks to our prototypes, we know what works and what can be better. With Kickstarter funding, we are planning a wide range of <span class="bold">upgrades and improvements</span> to ensure the final Animatronic Songbird Mini kits are durable, user-friendly, and truly magical. Here’s what we have in store for the next version of the Songbird Mini:</p><ul>
<li>
<span class="bold">Injection-Molded Parts:</span> We are completely redesigning all the bird’s parts for injection molding. This means replacing the 3D-printed prototype pieces with strong, smooth, production-quality plastic parts. The final kit will be more durable and professional, with components that fit perfectly and can withstand extensive use.</li>
<li>
<span class="bold">New Animatronic Controller:</span> Our engineering team is developing a custom animatronic controller board from the ground up. The prototype kits used off-the-shelf electronics; now we’re creating a dedicated controller tailored for the Songbird’s functions. The new controller will make the bird’s movements smoother and more lifelike, allow for easier programming of motion sequences, and potentially add features like sound or sensor integration down the line.</li>
<li>
<span class="bold">Upgraded Servos &amp; Electronics:</span> We plan to equip the final kit with higher-quality servo motors and electronic components. The prototype proved the concept, but we identified ways to improve reliability and performance. Higher Quality servos will result in more fluid movement (a twitch of the head, a opening/closing beak that looks natural), and robust electronics will ensure the bird operates consistently show after show. No more worries about a motor burning out during your big demo – our upgraded components aim for longevity.</li>
<li>
<span class="bold">Enhanced Art Materials &amp; Packaging:</span> In the prototype phase, we provided basic art supplies to decorate the bird. For the final product, we’re sourcing <span class="bold">high-quality art materials</span> (paints, brushes, faux feathers/fur, etc.) so that every creator can give their bird a truly polished look. We’re also designing attractive, informative packaging that doubles as a storage case for the kit. The packaging will include a colorful instruction booklet and educational content about animatronics, making the unboxing experience just as exciting as the build.</li>
<li>
<span class="bold">Sustainable Domestic Supply Chain:</span> We are committed to building a <span class="bold">sustainable supply chain</span> for this product. That means sourcing components and materials from reliable suppliers, largely within the USA, to minimize shipping delays and ensure quality. By creating a domestic supply network, we support local businesses and maintain greater control over manufacturing and quality assurance. It’s good for the product and good for the community.</li>
<li>
<span class="bold">Made in the USA – Final Production:</span> We plan to manufacture the Animatronic Songbird Mini entirely in the United States. Final injection molding, assembly of kits, and packaging will all be done domestically. This not only helps us oversee every step for top-notch quality, but also means backers can trust that the product is being made ethically and with care. “Made in the USA” is a point of pride for us – especially since Garner Holt Productions itself has always built its animatronic magic right here at home.</li>

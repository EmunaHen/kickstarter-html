It’s a new kind of wellness experience; one that adapts to your state of being and supports your pursuit of rest, energy, and mental clarity.</p><p><span class="bold">Why We Care</span></p><p>Our journey started with a simple truth: modern life takes a toll on both body and mind. We’re constantly navigating fast-paced routines that leave little room to pause, reflect, and recharge. After experiencing the transformative impact of science-backed sensory technologies, we were inspired to create a solution that brings those benefits to more people - easily and naturally.</p><p>Our founder, Robin, began this journey after a life-altering car accident. Frustrated by traditional paths that didn’t address his deeper needs for balance and resilience, he set out to build something new. Years of research, development, and personal experimentation led to K.I.M.- a tool born from challenge, driven by science, and designed for modern wellness.</p><p><span class="bold">How We’ll Make It Happen</span></p><p>We’ve refined K.I.M. over years of development and real-world testing. With your support, we’ll fund:</p><p>The first large-scale manufacturing run</p><p>Completion of our app and content ecosystem (including guided meditation and suggestion sessions, Yoga, Barre, Pilates with leading coaches, and performance-focused sessions)</p><p>Final quality checks and optimization for global release</p><p><span class="bold">Who We Are</span></p><p>We’re RemedyPulse group Inc., a New York-based team of wellness innovators, technologists, and creators. With expertise in sensory design, AI, and human performance, we’re building tools that help people recharge more intentionally and live with greater clarity.</p><p>Our mission is simple: empower people to feel their best by reconnecting with the body’s natural rhythms; through science, design, and accessible daily practice.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks" id="risks-and-challenges"><h2 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h2><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">1. Manufacturing Delays:
Scaling up production for a first product run can bring unexpected delays. To mitigate this, we’ve partnered with experienced manufacturers and a 3PL partner in Texas for packaging and fulfillment. We have also built buffer time into our production schedule to ensure we meet delivery commitments.

2. Quality Control:
K.I.M. integrates advanced vibration and sound technology, which requires precision and rigorous testing. We’ve developed strict quality control protocols and will test each unit thoroughly before shipping to backers to ensure a flawless experience.

3. Supply Chain Fluctuations:
Global supply chains can experience price fluctuations or part shortages. We have multiple vetted suppliers and backup sourcing strategies to reduce the risk of disruption.

4. App &amp; Software Development:
Our K.I.M. app and AI features require continuous updates to ensure the best user experience. We have a dedicated software team and a monthly maintenance plan with our developers to deliver on time and roll out improvements seamlessly.

We are transparent about these challenges, but our team’s experience, existing partnerships, and rigorous planning give us the confidence that we will deliver on time and beyond expectations.

	•	High-Quality Materials: The outer layer is made of reinforced, water-resistant, and easy-to-clean eco-leather, ensuring it withstands daily use and heavy pressure without wear.
	•	Industrial-Grade Motor &amp; Electronics: We use low-vibration, high-efficiency motors and premium electronic components tested for thousands of hours of use.
	•	Replaceable Parts &amp; Modular Design: Key components, such as the vibration motors, are designed to be easily serviced or replaced, extending the lifespan beyond typical wellness devices.
	•	Protective Coating: The internal hardware is protected against moisture and sweat damage with specialized coatings.


With proper care, K.I.M. is built to last for years of consistent use while maintaining peak performance.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Sustainable Distribution</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">Sustainability is a core value in how we produce and deliver K.I.M.:
	•	Eco-Friendly Packaging: We are using 100% recyclable packaging materials and minimizing unnecessary plastic. Each unit will be packaged with a focus on durability and environmental responsibility.
	•	Local 3PL Fulfillment: By partnering with a 3PL facility in Texas, we reduce the carbon footprint associated with international shipping and streamline last-mile delivery.
	•	Optimized Shipping Routes: We will work with carriers that offer carbon-neutral shipping options and optimized logistics to minimize emissions.
	•	Durability Over Disposability: K.I.M. is designed to last for years, reducing the need for frequent replacements and lowering environmental impact over its lifetime.
	•	Recycling &amp; Return Program (Future Initiative): We plan to introduce a program where older units can be returned for proper recycling or repurposing as we scale.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span>Questions about this project? </span><span class="bold link-blue type-16">Check out the FAQ</span></div></div><div id="report-this-project"><span class="kds-button kds-button">Report this project to Kickstarter</span></div></div>

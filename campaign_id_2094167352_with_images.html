<li>Enjoy working out</li>
<li>Avoid injury</li>
<li>Learn new and fun kettlebell exercises</li>
<li>To get strong</li>
<li>To get fit</li>
<li>To feel good</li>
</ul><p>And most importantly, focus on longevity with just one popular tool (the kettlebell) and the only support they need in one place (KETTLEBELL MONSTER).</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49796128">

<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:UNIQUE-OFFERINGS">UNIQUE OFFERINGS</h3><p>The <span>mobile app's</span> unique offerings are that it allows people to create their customized kettlebell workouts for free, explore hundreds of free kettlebell exercise photos, complete hundreds of uniquely designed workouts, and more.</p><p>But on top of that, we deliver way more for little money but huge value. You can see our current matrix above that explains the features delivered by the app. As a backer, you will get access to member videos, full workout access, courses, certifications, ebooks, and more depending on the level chosen (Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum).</p><p>Members will be able to view professionally produced videos for each session (currently works on the website), which include many of or all of the following: introduction, warm-up technique, workout technique, common mistakes, alternatives and progression, programming, follow-along warm-up, follow-along prep work, follow-along workout, and follow-along cooldown. </p><p>Then we go further and include copies of our popular ebooks that cover kettlebell technique, exercises, workouts, and more. These books have been sold on <span>Amazon</span> and many other places for the past decades.</p><p>We don't stop there, as we also include courses and certifications in some of the memberships. This means that people can get certified online through our website. We have NASM-accredited courses. We have certifications that we've been offering through our other websites for years, and have created many experienced kettlebell users.</p><p>Some levels of our memberships even include personalized coaching, i.e., working with a real professional human being. This means you don't need to spin your wheels anymore by taking on board thousands of different opinions from every internet user who may or may not have any credibility or knowledge.  </p>
<p>Future items not listed in the feature matrix are Advanced Workout Timer and integration with custom-created workouts, Kettlebell Challenges, Kettlebell Sport Tracking functionality, and all that's in the pipeline.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Support-and-Judges">Support and Judges</h4><p>Because our application places emphasis on education and we also provide certifications, another unique feature is that people can become certified and then list themselves as a judge on the network. Judges can be called upon to count valid reps for challenges, competitions, and even workouts.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Accurate-and-Qualified">Accurate and Qualified</h4><p><span class="bold">But there is so much free kettlebell and workout stuff out there!?</span> Yes, there are a lot of run-of-the-mill slapped-together workouts. There are a lot of Men's Health Magazines with information. But most of these highly popular magazines or YouTube channels just put incredibly bad form and technique out there. Most of these trainers go through a 1 to 2 hour online kettlebell certification (if even that) and then believe to be qualified<span class="text-italic">—but they have a six-pack and huge biceps</span>. Once you experience KETTLEBELL MONSTER and the quality of IKU™, you will know what you've been missing out on. We deliver highly accurate content through qualified coaches and bring all that content to the world via a social network that interacts with the exercises, combos, complexes, flows, hybrid workouts, and more. </p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Got-no-kettlebell-yet-">Got no kettlebell yet?</h4><p>The beauty is that you can easily buy yourself one kettlebell to start with. I have written a lengthy article on how to make an informed decision on <span>what kettlebell to buy</span>, and when you join this campaign, with the ebooks, videos, instructionals, etc., you will have everything to start your kettlebell journey and become addicted to KETTLEBELL MONSTER. </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49793519">

Everyone has their friends on there, their photo albums, and basically their life experiences. But... however great Facebook is, it is full of political stuff, keyboard warriors, and people with big egos.</p><p>When you want to work out, interact with people, track your progress, share your progress, gain knowledge, ask questions, and more, then you want to be able to do that in an environment where people are interested in your progress, <span class="bold">where you inspire others</span>, where you can get knowledge from people that actually know about the topic you are interested in.</p><p>Sure, you have to pay to get the full benefits<span class="text-italic">, while Facebook is free, </span>but we're all willing to pay a reasonable price to be able to interact with like-minded people and have access to all the latest tools and premium content to be able to track our progress.</p><p>Who isn't willing to pay to also be able to actually contact the company they contract a service from? Rather than typing in long sentences and having an AI trying to be smart and deliver you <span class="text-italic">'an answer'</span>, when in my case, it never does.</p><p>One guarantee is that we will not outsource our support to 10th-level support peeps who read a script and have no idea how to answer when you go off-script (it's not in their little database), and then you go back and forth 10 times before you get so angry that they finally put you through to 9th-level support, and one year later you are finally speaking to a person who understands how to fix your issue or answer your question.</p><p>The whole social aspect of working out, sharing, interacting, and more is what's currently missing from our Web and App. A large part of this campaign is to fund that.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49793539">

<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:THE-MARKET">THE MARKET</h3><p>Sure, these are just some stats taken from the internet, but we all know that kettlebells are on the rise.

The market is projected to reach $1.5 billion by 2033, with a 7.2% CAGR from 2025 to 2033. This growth is fueled by the versatility of kettlebells, their cost-effectiveness, and the rise of online fitness trends.</span></p><p><span class="text-italic">In 2024, the number of kettlebell users in the United States peaked at roughly 15.6 million.

<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:SINCE-2009">SINCE 2009</h3><p>In reality, we've been working on this project since 2009 in some form or another, as everything that is offered to its members is intellectual property that has been created with blood, sweat, passion, and tears. For years, we've been working to gather knowledge and produce:</p><ul>
<li>1,000+ kettlebell exercise photos</li>
<li>200+ unique workout sessions</li>
<li>20+ kettlebell workout books</li>
<li>10+ kettlebell courses and certifications</li>
<li>1,000+ hours of additional kettlebell video content</li>
</ul><p>All the books, videos, courses, and more have been created with my hands and brain. There is no AI involved. I have extensive knowledge and a unique approach to teaching people. I have translated these things into content and functionality that people from across the world can use. </p><p>Think of it like this. There is a huge amount of unique kettlebell-related content, and on top of all that content is the NETWORK. A network that focuses on:</p><ul>
<li>Accountability</li>
<li>Motivation</li>
<li>Progression</li>
<li>Safety</li>

<p>By the way, when I say "created with blood, sweat, passion, and tears", I mean that we've been all over the world with our kettlebells and dragged our kettlebells to places no kettlebell has gone before. I know this is corny, but here's a video of one of our experiences going up the highest mountain in mainland Spain.</p>
<p>We also went up there all the way to the top on our flip flops, carrying our 16kg kettlebell, tent, and more. When we got up there, people asked to take photos with our kettlebell, and we exchanged a photo for some chocolate. It was awesome. There is so much more adventure that I want to share with you, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49793573">

With your backing, we will be able to reduce that time to less than a year and potentially even less than 6 months. What we still have in the pipeline is, but not limited to:</p><ul>

This project is about making fitness fun and addictive, which is something that the kettlebell can and will deliver, it has for me, and I'm over half a century of age. The same goes for my wife. We both still learn, we are both still entertained by the kettlebell, and we still have so many different goals to reach with the kettlebell. </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49793638">

We don't limit the knowledge and fun to just one, as there is so much more to explore outside of those, and then combining them. We also place a high focus on longevity with our workouts, which means we provide hybrid workouts that include a lot of mobility work.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49793647">

<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:KETTLEBELL-MONSTERTM">KETTLEBELL MONSTER™</h3><p>We picked the name KETTLEBELL MONSTER to stand out and have something memorable. We've not created a logo and just keep it as text, as we don't want to associate scaryness or anything other than what it is. An incredibly cool application that provides everything one needs to work out and stay motivated.</p><p>We are different. We don't beat around the bush, and we say it as it is. Feeling old is not due to age. It's due to inactivity and/or incorrect training. We're here to help everyone take the right road and enjoy their life with added mobility, strength, endurance, and more. If you see older people struggling to move, it's usually not because they're old. It's generally because they stopped moving, aren't moving enough, or aren't moving correctly with the right program and progressions. We're here to help change the myth that getting older means not being able to do stuff like you did at twenty years of age.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:NOT-A-FAD">NOT A FAD</h3><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:In-business-since-2009">In business since 2009</h4><p>This is not some fad. This is not something that might go away. This is not something that will not succeed. </p><p>My wife and I have been operating in the fitness industry since 2004; she has even been in it longer than that. In 2009, we created our first online presence with Cavemantraining™, which is still and will always be operating. In 2024, we started IKU™, which stands for International Kettlebell University. We did this for several reasons. To sound more professional, and I say 'sound', as we have always been professional, and reach a wider audience.</p><p>To make it simple: Cavemantraining™ created the content over 2 decades. IKU™ is a legal company registered in the USA. KETTLEBELL MONSTER™ is the one and only thing that matters in regard to this Kickstarter, as it's the project that will deliver everything mentioned.</p><p>We've sold thousands of books on Amazon.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49782067">

<p>Here is another <span>video</span>, which BTW is part of our YouTube channel, which has over 68,000+ subscribers.</p><p>On one network where we have been providing online courses, I have a star rating of 4.7 out of 5 with over 1,052 reviews. </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49782636">

As Gold includes 15 minutes of coaching, and Platinum includes 30 minutes of coaching, which requires human time, the risk is that we don't get qualified trainers in place to handle these requests. Therefore, we have to put a caveat on this small part of the web membership that's included. If the app receives the same functionality in the future, this caveat will apply to that as well. In other words, we will provide the service as intended, but as we get overwhelmed with thousands of people requesting coaching at the same time, and we don't have the qualified staff in place to handle the volume, the caveat will apply. NOTE: This caveat has absolutely no impact on all other rewards offered, only on the web and app for Gold and Platinum, and only for the coaching part.</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span>Questions about this project? </span><span class="bold link-blue type-16">Check out the FAQ</span></div></div><div id="report-this-project"><span class="kds-button kds-button">Report this project to Kickstarter</span></div></div>

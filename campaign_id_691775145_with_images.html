The original ZX Spectrum sparked a generation of coders, gamers, and dreamers to build the future we live in.

It follows the success of our two previous Kickstarter campaigns (delivering over 10,000 units worldwide) and introduces a larger, more powerful FPGA (Artix A7 XC7A35T-2CSG324C), support for additional platforms like the Sinclair QL and Commodore 64, and a ton more enhancements under the hood.</p><p>Whether you're a lifelong Speccy fan or just rediscovering the joy of owning a computer you can truly master, explore and make your own, the Next Issue 3 is the most powerful 8-bit computer out there..</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Seeeeriously cool looking computer, this ZX Spectrum Next..." data-id="50051346">

<span class="bold">Hundreds of new games and apps</span>, most in boxed releases for collection</li>
<li>
<span class="bold">Improved graphics:</span> 256 colour modes, copper effects, tilemaps and hardware sprites</li>
<li>
<span class="bold">Enhanced sound:</span> 9-channel stereo audio + dual stereo DACs</li>
<li>Built-in networking, faster storage, and modern ports such as HDMI</li>
<li>Fully compatible with classic ZX Spectrum hardware and software, no emulation in sight</li>
</ul><p>Play the classics as they were meant to be played, or re-experience them with turbo modes and enhancements. Then dive into a whole new generation of Next-exclusive games like <span class="text-italic">Saboteur Remastered</span>, <span class="text-italic">Head Over Heels Deluxe</span>, and <span class="text-italic">Lords of Midnight Next</span>.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="These games alone are sure to keep you playing your Next for a loooong time!" data-id="50005338">

To get started, all you need is a TV or monitor, a video cable and… that's it. The Next supports RGB, VGA, and HDMI output, so you’re free to choose anything from a vintage CRT to a modern high-end display.</p>
<p>You can start your journey with your favourite Speccy game, perhaps running at a turbo mode – 3D games such as <span class="text-italic">Driller </span>or<span class="text-italic"> Castle Master</span> run at full framerate on the 28MHz mode. Experience the new titles made exclusively for the machine featuring upgraded graphics and sound, and feel inspired to create your own game.</p><p>You can connect your ZX Spectrum Next to your Wi-Fi network and browse online collections of games, demos, mods and art ready to download and play with applications such as GetIt by team member David Saphier. </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="So many goodies online one can get lost and never, ever, find their way back.

<p>Every aspect of the ZX Spectrum Next is designed to put you in control, with an open and intuitive environment that encourages you to remix, expand, or simply learn from the games and apps as you build your own. It captures the spirit of a computer that feels personal the moment it's switched on, making the Next an ideal platform for learning about computing, free from the abstraction and complexity of modern operating systems.<br/> </p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Built-by-the-Community-Powered-by-You"><span class="bold">Built by the Community, Powered by You</span></h3><p>The ZX Spectrum Next was designed as a true successor of the Speccy, down to its industrial design by the late Rick Dickinson, the original in-house Sinclair designer and his partner Phil Candy. This means it packs small touches one should expect, from a responsive keyboard replacing ye ol’ rubber keys to hardware compatibility: you can even load your original games from cassette tape if you so want, or attach that ZX Spectrum expansion board you’ve got in the attic and it will just work.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Every single one of these lovely boxed games was created by a member of the Next community" data-id="50053817">

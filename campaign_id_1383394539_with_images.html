So are we.<br/><span class="text-italic">Stars Are Blind</span> is a revolutionary new dating platform that combines the wisdom of the <span class="bold">Western zodiac</span> (sun, moon, rising) and the <span class="bold">Eastern zodiac</span> (Chinese zodiac signs and elements) to create a <span class="bold">cosmic compatibility engine</span>.</p><p>This isn’t just about swiping. This isn’t a “hookup” site. This is true love.<br/>This is about <span class="bold">true connection</span> — guided by the stars.</p><p>This project will not fail — not with your help.</p><p>We’re on a mission to bring Stars Are Blind to the world. That means aggressive (but not intrusive) global marketing, strategic partnerships, and everything it takes to make sure every single person out there knows about this app and gets a chance to find their true match.</p><p>As our reach grows, so does your pool of potential matches — exponentially. Every backer, every share, every dollar moves us closer to a future where love is written in the stars and the code.</p><p>We’re building a space where emotional intelligence, astrology, and spiritual chemistry take the lead in helping you find love that <span class="text-italic">feels fated</span>.</p><p>✨ What Makes <span class="text-italic">Stars Are Blind</span> Different?</p><p>✅ Dual-zodiac compatibility: We analyze both <span class="bold">Eastern and Western birth data</span> to calculate deep romantic potential. Users will have the option to disable zodiac options to see the entire pool.</p><p>✅ Full birth chart input: Go beyond your sun sign — enter birth time, place, and more for richer matches.</p><p>✅ Personalized insights: Get your own <span class="bold">cosmic love map</span>, plus tips for nurturing the kinds of relationships you’re meant for.</p><p>✅ Conscious community: A respectful, inclusive, and safe dating space for people of <span class="bold">all identities and orientations</span>.</p><p>✅ Spiritual, not superficial: We're here for those who crave depth, insight, and meaning — not just another match.</p><p>🪐 Where the Funds Will Go</p><p>We’ve completed early research, design concepts, and backend planning.

Building a dating platform with dual zodiac integration is exciting — but it does come with a few challenges. Here’s how we’re planning to handle them:
🛠️ 1. Technical Development

Creating an app that accurately combines Eastern and Western astrology in real-time matching is complex.
How we’ll manage it: We’re partnering with experienced developers and astrologers to ensure the app is accurate, scalable, and reliable. We’ll start with a minimal viable product (MVP) and roll out features gradually.

⏱️ 2. Delays in Launch

As with any tech project, unexpected issues could delay the timeline.
How we’ll manage it: We’re building a flexible roadmap with buffer time built in. If delays occur, we’ll keep backers updated transparently.

🔒 3. Privacy &amp; Security

Dating apps involve sensitive user data — from birth times to personal conversations.
How we’ll manage it: We are prioritizing data protection from the beginning, including secure authentication, encrypted data storage, and optional anonymity settings.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 4. Community Moderation

Creating a safe, respectful space online takes work.
How we’ll manage it: We’ll implement human-backed moderation, user reporting tools, and a strict no-tolerance policy for harassment or hate speech.

📈 5. Scaling the Platform

If the app grows quickly (yay!), we’ll need to scale infrastructure and support.
How we’ll manage it: Our development plan is designed to scale in phases. Kickstarter funding helps us prepare for growth early on.</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Use of AI</h2></div><div class="border-bottom mb2"><h3 class="normal type-18 mt5">I plan to use AI-generated content in my project.</h3><h4 class="bold lh4" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What parts of your project will use AI generated content?

We're building Stars Are Blind not just as a dating app, but as a long-term platform and community grounded in astrological connection. Here's how we’ll ensure its continued growth:

Sustainable Design &amp; Development
We’re using scalable architecture that allows us to update features, improve algorithms, and expand to mobile without rebuilding from scratch.

Content-Driven Engagement
Astrology is ever-evolving, so we’ll offer fresh, relevant content — like horoscopes, match insights, and moon-phase dating tips — to keep users coming back regularly.

Community Building
Our focus is on conscious connection and inclusivity. We’ll nurture a respectful, spiritually-minded dating space where users feel seen and valued — leading to organic retention and word-of-mouth growth.

Premium Features &amp; Monetization
We’ll introduce optional paid features (like deep compatibility reports and exclusive match tools) to support long-term development without compromising the free experience.

Ongoing Iteration Based on Feedback
We'll listen closely to our users and continuously improve the app based on their needs, ensuring Stars Are Blind stays relevant and aligned with its audience over time.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span>Questions about this project? </span><span class="bold link-blue type-16">Check out the FAQ</span></div></div><div id="report-this-project"><span class="kds-button kds-button">Report this project to Kickstarter</span></div></div>

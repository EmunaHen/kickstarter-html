It also leverages the higher peak brightness of HDR displays, reaching over +4EV above the best SDR monitors.<br/>This technology enables a faithful reproduction of <span class="bold">highlights

years now, excellent HDR displays on the RAW development workstation (such as an OLED WRGB that also improves black-and-white viewing) have allowed photographers to view a dynamic range far above traditional SDR and a color gamut well beyond sRGB. </p><p><img

TVs and monitors are sold factory-calibrated and thus faithfully reproduce HDR colors as intended by the photographer, beyond 8bits shades limit of standard JPEGs and avoiding color banding (<span class="text-italic">even if, as you can see, here in Kickstarter the images loaded are compressed and color banding is produced also in right part of the image above</span>).</p><p><img

late 2023, <span class="bold">digital development software has offered HDR photo editing and export</span>, extending photo dynamic range beyond SDR up to brightness and detail levels previously possible only in HDR video (<span class="text-italic">see above </span><span>Adobe Lightroom HDR</span>).</p><p>But <span class="bold">how can a photographer let others</span>—an audience—<span class="bold">see his HDR photos?</span><br/>Maybe you can bring people in front of your editing workstation.</p><p><img

people can view HDR photos on a mid-high level smartphone, where the screen is tiny for a photographer’s aspirations, and the audience gets distracted by everything around.</p><p>Now, not only recent photos <span class="bold">can be HDR-processed</span>, but <span class="bold">all RAW or TIFF images</span>, maybe even the ones you have in your archive since more than 10 years, using recent digital development or editing software.</p><p>If a photographer can now easily produce HDR photos, until today it has been complex to show them to others, to an audience.</p><p><img

that rely on higly compressed HDR files type used for saving photos: HEIC or HEIF, JPEG, JPEG XL and AVIF (not on the big TIFF files), prpduced not only by editing software, but also shooting with modern cameras from main manufacturers.</p><p><img

HDR photos can be viewed correctly:<br/>- inside only certain digital development and editing software;<br/>- on Apple Macs only using certain apps;<br/>- using some web browsers on Windows or Mac (i.e Chrome and Edge);<br/>- on many recent smartphones (of mid-high level).</p><p>But it is more complicated: only some HDR file formats can be saved by some devices or software, and only some formats can be viewed by certain devices and software, as shown in the following table:</p><p><img src="https://i.kickstarter.com/assets/049/311/814/d5e160ac0b55ceb635d835ddff609920_original.jpeg?fit=scale-down&amp;origin=ugc&amp;q=92&amp;v=1747465473&amp;width=1285&amp;sig=wkElO4M3eGQCezGXpwA4IdfEjxqGcW3gv1lCbWdA3rE%3D"/></p><p>HDR file images often are not display correctly on screens, due to operating system limitations, or appear with false colors because of software designed only for SDR images (also listed in the same prevoius table).</p><p><span class="bold">However, there is still no device or system, that not only correctly displays HDR photos, but also manages a complete image archive with elements like albums and programmable slideshows</span>.<br/>At best, you’ll find a few editing or development software extensions that publish edited photos in an HTML page (which then requires a web server).<br/>There is nothing else that allows you to comfortably manage published photos from many editing sessions, works created at different times and places, nor to group all these images into albums or slideshows.</p><p>Web services like <span>Zonerama.com</span> allow HDR image viewing with albums and manual slideshows, but with heavy aesthetic constraints: never truly full-screen, overlaid with interactive buttons, company logo, album title, and other text.</p><p><img

HDRplayer <span class="bold">micro-PC</span> features the most advanced video ports and up to 12-bit color (HDMI and DP via Thunderbolt USB-C, all with HDR support), the latest mass storage (NVMe, microSD, and USB 3.2), WiFi and Ethernet networking, USB upload option, a fanless cooling design, is powerd by USB-C Power Delivery and is easily configurable (based on Microsoft Windows 11).<br/>HDRplayer <span class="bold">software </span>manages a database indexing photo, album, and slideshow, enabling scheduling, storage management, and a server for image upload.</p><p>The HDRplayer case has been architecturally designed to both hide the connections and to show a simple and pleasing device and only the cables needed.<br/>It will made using sustainable materials and with sustainable processes and open to the development of services for the future of photography and for the photographers of the future.</p><p><span class="bold">With HDRplayer all photographers will soon be able to easily display their HDR photos to any audience.</span></p><p>The idea was born among tech-minded photographers discussing digital photography innovation.<br/>The concept of HDRplayer comes from <span class="bold">Andrea Vivoda</span>, a researcher and freelancer working on multimedia communication solutions, especially for museums, exhibitions, education, and congress events—solutions beyond mere IT. Editing his HDR photos and pleased with results on his OLED display, he wondered how to let viewers see his images as well as he did.</p><p><img src="https://i.kickstarter.com/assets/049/311/818/a2fcfee38bd164f56b50fa45f46b4834_original.jpeg?fit=scale-down&amp;origin=ugc&amp;q=92&amp;v=1747465473&amp;width=1285&amp;sig=uANsym3OoogmiMICxJu3j2D9fWN9qytM8QRYh3csMNQ%3D"/></p><p>The solution wasn’t just finding other HDR displays  with wide color gamuts (or PCs with embedded HDR displays like the recent Apple MacBook Pro), but creating a player that handles files, color spaces, and a 10-bit signal to the display. As a computer scientist, Andrea Vivoda combined a small PC, a display, and the right software. Simple for an IT expert, complex for a photographer. Moreover, it wasn’t enough to view only the latest exported photos: there are countless existing and future photos, conventionally organized in albums.<br/>Something more complete and versatile was needed.<br/>If it were also simpler, it would suit all photographers: thus was the idea of HDRplayer.</p><p>Andrea discussed the idea with his friend <span class="bold">Mauro Fain</span>, CEO of <span class="bold">FINEWARE</span>, with whom he had collaborated on client solutions and innovation experiments. Mauro, passionate about PC connectivity, has years of experience in tech innovation and prototyping with various professionals and companies.<br/><br/>Then we looked into whether there were other HDR products already on the market or mentioned on the websites and online channels commonly used by photographers. The only significant result we found was a section of a website dedicated to HDR photography (<span>https://gregbenzphotography.com/hdr</span>), which we found to be highly relevant and aligned with many of our practical observations (it explores the HDR topic in even greater depth than we had reached in our own applied research — for example, by offering in-depth resources and software tools for HDR editing and digital development, as well as a wealth of educational material, including a graphical test for assessing the HDR capabilities of a PC connected to an HDR display).</p><p>Therefore, since we couldn’t find anything already available that offered the complete and simple solution, we envisioned for allowing photographers to showcase all their photos in HDR, merging Andrea’s ideas whit Mauro’s competencies and FINEWARE’s programming, organizational, and production expertise, the HDRplayer project took shape, envisioning future related products under the PHOTONoBOOK brand, of which HDRplayer is the first.</p><p>As you can easily see, HDRplayer and PHOTONoBOOK are intended for digital photographers all around the world — not just those near us or based in Italy. In other words, we’re reaching out to photographers who can only be connected with through a global platform like Kickstarter. And that’s exactly why we’re here!</p><p><span class="text-italic">(Disclaimer: all the images and video you can see in Kickstarter are SDR: there is no way here to show an HDR file.</span><br/><span class="text-italic">In case you have a HDR display and want to whatch a demo of HDR images, we shall relay on other platforms i.e. Youtube.com for videos ar Zonerama.com for photos)</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks" id="risks-and-challenges"><h2 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h2><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">The design of HDRplayer is carefully curated, as it is intended for discerning photographers with a strong appreciation for visual quality. The interface will be minimal and unobtrusive, ensuring that the focus remains entirely on the images themselves—photographs rendered on HDR displays in their full luminance, with rich color depth and accurate tonal reproduction. To this end, we are collaborating with an architect to optimize both form and function in the product’s physical and visual design.
While basic HDR file viewing is already a solved technical problem, the real challenge in developing HDRplayer lies in designing, implementing, and validating software that is both highly functional and intuitive to use. The goal is a tool that combines operational simplicity with a robust feature set tailored to the needs of photographers. For this reason, the design and development process will actively involve consultations with both professional and amateur photographers, allowing us to integrate practical insights into the user interface and to address specific functional requirements that may emerge from real-world workflows.
HDRplayer includes, in addition to the software, three hardware components:
- A micro PC, sourced from third-party manufacturers and fully certified according to international standards (CE / UL / GS / CB / FCC / PSE / UKCA / BIS / CCC / RoHS 2.0);
- An HDMI connection cable, also third-party manufactured and compliant with all applicable certification requirements;
- A custom aesthetic enclosure made of PLA (polylactic acid) and/or wood, with no mechanical or structural functions, and therefore not subject to mandatory certification under current regulations.
Anyway, we recognize that every project involves inherent risks and challenges, some beyond our control despite thorough planning. Should such circumstances arise, we commit to communicating with complete transparency to you, our valued backers, and to resolving any issues promptly and effectively.</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-commitments" id="environmentalCommitments"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Environmental commitments</h2><span><span class="ksr-green-700">Visit our Environmental Resources Center</span> to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.</span></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Long-lasting design</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">The evolution of digital photography has certainly been slower than that of video, but it is now accelerating—and HDRplayer is right at that inflection point. However, digital photo playback still relies on JPEG files, a standard defined back in 1992. This persistence is due in large part to the vast installed base of devices that generate or process JPEGs. Adoption of newer image formats for digital photography (HEIC/HEIF, AVIF, JPEG XL) is only just beginning, and one of these will likely emerge as the new photographic standard—outlasting the others for decades to come.
Screen resolutions are converging on 4K, which even on large‐format displays delivers outstanding image quality without the need to jump to 8K (which would also entail vastly larger file sizes). By building HDRplayer on a conventional PC platform, we ensure maximum compatibility with both existing and future image formats. The compute power required to display individual 4K HDR stills is very low, and the ultra‐low‑power processor selected for HDRplayer (currently the Intel N100) is more than sufficient for today’s and tomorrow’s HDR file workflows.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Reusability and recyclability</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">Beyond the embedded micro‑PC, HDRplayer is constructed entirely from plant‑based materials: PLA (polylactic acid) or wood, both of which are fully recyclable. Only a few small components—metal screws and recycled‑felt feet—are not plant‑based. The packaging is likewise made from recycled, recyclable cardboard, printed in a single color with minimal environmental impact.
The micro‑PC ships with Windows 11 and can be repurposed as a conventional PC for any other software once the user’s need for an image player has passed.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Sustainable materials</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">All materials are sourced as sustainably as possible (with the exception of PC):
- the PLA filament used for 3D printing is certified 100 % recycled by the manufacturer;
- the wood is reclaimed exclusively from decommissioned European cherry trees (they ended cherry production because are old), finished only with natural wax;
- no paints or varnishes are used.

The micro PC is very efficient: It is powered by USB-C PD and during a working test we measured a power consumption of only 12W (the Intel N100 CPU is rated 6W TDP) and therefore it has a very low impact.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Environmentally friendly factories</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">Fineware’s headquarters—where we perform final assembly, configuration, and 3D printing—are equipped with rooftop photovoltaics and battery bank, providing several kilowatts of power, enough to run all company equipment used in the HDRplayer project on renewably generated electricity.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Sustainable Distribution</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">HDRplayer is a product made for a global market, and we will ship via Poste Italiane’s express service, which offers reasonably swift delivery times—perhaps not the fastest in the industry, but enabling larger consolidated shipments, lower costs, and reduced environmental impact. Nonetheless, all long‑distance transport consumes non‑renewable resources and contributes to pollution, especially on intercontinental routes. To compensate the emissions, caused not only by delivery, but also made in the industrial production chain of the micro PC, we will fund forest restoration campaign (see later in “Other”).
While we are required to purchase microPCs and cables from the country where they are manufactured—namely China—all other components we use come from sustainable suppliers:
    • The wooden cases are sourced from a local workshop. We are located in what was, until recently, the world’s largest chair manufacturing district, which has preserved extensive expertise in woodworking.
    • As for the packaging, it is specifically designed to maximize compactness and reduce weight, and is made exclusively from recycled cardboard, printed with low-impact monochrome ink.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Something else</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">For each HDRplayer will be backed, we will sustain the forest restoration campaign of INSTITUTO TERRA in Brazil, which was funded by Lélia Deluiz Wanick Salgado and Sebastião Salgado.
The same sustain will be backed for each yearly software subscription HDRplayer will receive for upgrades and dedicated assistance.
It is a way we, photographers, have to express our gratitude to the Salgado family: for Sebastião’s extraordinary photographic work—made possible by Lélia’s indispensable collaboration—and for Lélia’s outstanding efforts in reforesting the Atlantic Forest, with Sebastião’s significant support (https://refloresta.institutoterra.org/alliedbusiness).</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span>Questions about this project? </span><span class="bold link-blue type-16">Check out the FAQ</span></div></div><div id="report-this-project"><span class="kds-button kds-button">Report this project to Kickstarter</span></div></div>

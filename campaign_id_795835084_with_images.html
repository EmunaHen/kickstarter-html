<h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:What-is-SensorNode-">What is SensorNode?</h4><p>SensorNode is a simple credit-card sized PC board with a Raspberry Pi Pico W installed on it. The Pico is loaded with software that enables many common home-automation sensors to be interfaced to Home Assistant, one of the most popular open-source home automation software solutions available. All you do is attach sensors to it, configure it through the built-in Wifi Access Point, and run. Although all the code is Open-Sourced, you don't need to write code to use SensorNode.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="46624722">

<p>SensorNode was designed to interface S2 to a DS18B20 'Dallas Semi' type of temperature sensor which uses a very common digital '1-wire' interface (in actuality, the interface is THREE wires: POWER (5V), GROUND, and DATA. The DATA line implements a serial protocol to transfer digital data, thus the '1-wire' nomenclature).

<p><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">--&gt; THE TRICK to using any ONE of these THREE TYPES of Sensors lies in JUMPER J3 on the SensorNode PC Board.

This is a very simple interface in which the device uses HTTP POST commands to make sensor reports to Home Assistant. For this to work, you must first specify the following in the SensorNode Configuration Settings (through the WiFi Access Point):</p><ul>
<li>
<span class="bold">Home Assistant URI</span> - this is the network path to your local Home Assistant install. By default, SensorNode is set to the Home Assistant default path: "http://homeassistant.local:8123" but you can change it to anything you want. Note: SensorNode MUST be on the <span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">same network</span></span> as Home Assistant to work.</li>
<li>
<span class="bold">Home Assistant 'long-lived' access token.</span> This will authenticate SensorNode to Home Assistant. You need to go into Home Assistant settings, obtain one of these tokens, and then paste it into your SensorNode Settings.</li>
</ul><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Setup-and-Configuration-with-a-Smartphone-No-App-Needed-">Setup and Configuration with a Smartphone - No App Needed!</h4><p>One of the reasons SensorNode is so easy to set up and use is the fact that <span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">you do not need an app or any cloud service</span></span> to use SensorNode. Just plug it in and turn it on. The first time SensorNode is turned on, it will attempt to join the local WiFi, but if it does not have correct credentials (or for some other reason this fails), SensorNode will immediately create a WiFi Access Point (AP) that you can attach to with any smartphone, computer, etc.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="SensorNode in Access Point Mode" data-id="46609524">

<p>After you attach to SensorNode's AP, simply open a browser and point it to 192.168.4.1 and the <span class="bold">SensorNode Configuration Server</span> will open. From there you can set up SensorNode with WiFi credentials, Home Assistant info, and enable all desired sensors. You can even give SensorNode and/or the sensors custom names so you can more easily identify them on your Home Assistant dashboards.</p><p>If you ever want to change any of the SensorNode's settings, there is a switch on the board to force the unit into AP mode. Simply turn it off, throw the switch to 'AP', then turn it back on. SensorNode will go into AP mode and you can modify any settings you wish.

<p>One of the advantages of using the Pico is that is has a built-in I2C interface. There are literally dozens of I2C devices out there, but for now <span class="bold">I've only implemented one</span> - the <span class="bold">AHT20 combo temperature and humidity sensor</span>. This is primarily intended to be an 'internal' sensor close to SensorNode, but for those who want it, you can either buy the AHT20 directly from <span>Adafruit</span> or you can get the add-on from me. All you have to do is plug it in and turn SensorNode on. It's that easy. Also, I've put both a 'STEMMA' connector <span class="bold">and</span> a standard header on the SensorNode board - either will work.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Easy-to-build-yourself">Easy to build yourself</h4><p>I designed the SensorNode PC Board to make it easy for me to build for myself. It uses simple, cheap components. All the parts are through-hole (except the STEMMA I2C connector which you don't absolutely need) so if you know how to solder it shouldn't take you long to build your own SensorNode. Of course, you can purchase the already-assembled versions, but the point is <span class="bold">you don't have to</span>.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Options">Options</h3><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Custom-3D-Printed-SensorNode-Enclosure">Custom 3D-Printed SensorNode Enclosure</h4><p>NOTE: Every SensorNode purchase will give you access to the 3D-Printer files to print your own SensorNode Enclosure at no extra charge!</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="SensorNode Custom 3D-Printed Enclosure" data-id="46324344">

I have 5 such setups which have been working non-stop for months. But - no guarantees :)</span></p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:The-Back-Story">The Back Story</h3><p>My name is Tom Berarducci - I'm a retired electrical engineer who used to build things for big companies. Now I build things for myself. Recently, I had to replace my aging home automation system with something new. I looked around and decided on Home Assistant. I started adding devices and quickly found that, although there are a TON of devices available for Home Assistant, I could leverage my experience in IOT (Internet of Things) work to add my own unique take on sensors to not only save money, but increase simplicity, robustness, and flexibility to my Home Assistant installation. Then, I considered that others might benefit from this work.</p><p>Thus, SensorNode was born.</p><p>I chose things mainly based upon simplicity. I chose the Raspberry Pi Pico W as the main brain of the system, because it's cheap ($6-7), available, can be programmed in Python (I used CircuitPython), and has tons of General Purpose Input Outputs (GPIOs).</p><p>I chose AC power so I wouldn't have to bother with replacing batteries (see below). I chose the most common sensors I would want. I chose the Home Assistant HTTP interface for the SensorNode and all it's sensors cause it's simple and easy.</p><p>You can dynamically set up the SensorNode through the built-in WiFi Access Point. It can be set up for a Dry Contact Sensor on connector S1 and ONE of Motion, Temperature, OR Moisture Sensors on connector S2, along with optional I2C temp/humidity sensors. That gives you a possible 4 concurrent sensors which is just about all the Raspberry Pi Pico can handle.</p><p>These are my choices, for me. If you agree with them, AND if you are a person experienced in DIY, soldering, tinkering, power systems, etc., consider backing this project so that others can benefit from my work. Thanks.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Why-">Why?</h4><p>Why would I do this? Well, I had several reasons. If you agree with them, you might also want your own SensorNode. Read on.</p><p>First of all - I'm not in this to make money. My main goal is to let people who are Home Automation Geeks like me enjoy using SensorNode. Of course, I'm not planning on losing money either, so that's why I need to charge what I'm charging. I don't have a manufacturing arm in China and am not planning on mass production. That's why I'm selling bare boards and open-sourcing the code and 3D print files.</p><p>The main reason I came up with SensorNode was, as I was setting up my Home Automation system, I had the need for several Dry Contact switches (garage doors, fountains, push buttons, etc.) and found that there were few options available. The ones that were available were <span class="bold">expensive and battery-powered</span>. Neither of which I wanted.</p><p>So, as any good engineer would do - I built my own.</p><p>But of course, as I'm designing it, I realized I could add additional sensors at very little cost. It was frustrating that a simple dry contact switch (that works with Home Assistant) costs $20-40, and were all battery-powered. Also, I figured out that it was possible to design a circuit that could accommodate <span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">multiple sensors</span></span> at nearly the same cost. Now, you don't always need multiple sensors at the same location, but if you do, SensorNode is one of the cheapest ways to provide them.</p><p>But which sensors? Well, I quickly realized I couldn't provide ALL common sensors at the same time, the little Raspberry Pi Pico micro controller simply didn't have the power to do that and also provide the responsivity I was looking for. So I had to choose.</p><p>But I also didn't want a bunch of 'one-off' circuits all over my house. Too many unique boards, all requiring unique software, that had to be maintained. So I came up with ONE circuit, ONE board, and ONE software image that provided all the common sensor interfaces that I wanted - dry contact, motion, temperature, and moisture - all in ONE.</p><p>Plus, I threw in an I2C interface 'just in case' . Currently, this interface only supports ONE device - the AHT20 Temperature/Humidity sensor (I get mine from Adafruit). But, since the code is open-source you could add what you need.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Why-AC-Powered-">Why AC Powered?</h4><p>Most battery-powered devices claim 'up to one year battery life' and that's OK I guess, but that's not the whole story. The reason companies create battery powered devices is mainly for THEM, not you. It's easier. It avoids regulation and certification. They don't need to include a costly UL-Listed Wall Wart with their product. It pushes the burden of powering the device off on the user - YOU. It also makes the device safer - there's a reason children's toys are all battery-powered. </p><p>But batteries leak and corrode. They create toxic waste. They should only be used if absolutely necessary. If you have unique needs like portability or locations which don't have accessible power, you need batteries. But home sensors rarely require these things. So I try to avoid them. Why? Mainly because I'm lazy - I don't want to be constantly replacing batteries. You see, one device needing battery replacement every 12 months is not bad. But most self-respecting home automation junkies have WAY MORE than one device in their systems. My system currently has over 80 devices. How many are battery-powered? Three. You see, one device needing battery replacement every 12 months is manageable, but if you had 80 battery-powered devices, you'd be replacing batteries, on average, every 4.5 days! Not how I plan to spend my Golden Years...</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Current-Status">Current Status</h3><p>The design is complete. I have over 20 units up and running around my house, several of them for many months non-stop. Some for over 1 year. The hardware is very simple so I'm confident it will be robust. </p><p>The software, however, is kind of complex. Since the Pico is running CircuitPython, memory usage is a constant concern. I had to be creative about loading things to make sure I had enough memory in all of the various modes of operation. Because of this, the code is broken up into modules and only loaded when needed to make utilization as efficient as possible. To date, the code seems to work well and appears robust and fault-tolerant.</p><p>NOTE: Recently, the Pico 2 W has been launched by Raspberry Pi. I have done a small amount of testing with a Pico 2 W and it appears to work fine with the existing SensorNode code (you do need to use updated CircuitPython and 3rd-party libs). I still plan on shipping SensorNodes with the Pico 1 W however, since it works fine and is a little cheaper and perhaps more available for now. The included instructions will specify what changes need to be performed to work with the Pico 2 W. It's interesting to note that, since I went to so much trouble to get the code to work well on a Pico 1, there should be a LOT more headroom for changes with a Pico 2 since it has much more on-board memory.</p><p>The 3D Printed enclosures are done. In fact, I've been using them for months.</p><p>All the sensors are off the shelf. I don't make them. I'm only reselling them for those who would like the convenience of getting something curated and tested by me. </p><p>The power supply is a standard, off the shelf UL-Listed 12V wall wort. In fact, I've designed SensorNode so that it will work off any standard 7.5-24V power supply, as long as the configuration of the connector is compatible.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Work-Yet-to-be-Done">Work Yet to be Done</h4><ul>
<li>I need to create a SensorNode Web Presence to serve up all the digital deliverables for the project. </li>
<li>All the code needs to be put up on github.</li>
<li>I need to write all the documentation.</li>
<li>I may put up a simple store to sell SensorNodes after the Kickstarter is completed. Don't worry - you'll get your rewards before I ship them to anyone else.</li>
<li>I may investigate getting partners for:<ul>
<li>3D Printing in volume - if so I can lift or modify the quantity limits.</li>
<li>Manufacturing/Assembling the entire product if possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p><span class="text-italic">--&gt; Most of this work only makes sense IF the project is successfully funded. If the Kickstarter is not successful, then I may not do any of this. So it's basically up to you.</span></p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Shipping">Shipping</h3><p><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">Please note that, because this is my first Kickstarter, I will only be able to ship to US addresses only. I'm sorry if this causes some of you to not back the project, but international shipping is just too much of a pain for me to bite off this go-around. </span></span></p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:A-Note-about-Security">A Note about Security</h3><p>Right now SensorNode uses HTTP for device-server communication exclusively. I have not implemented HTTPS for encrypted communication. To be honest, I'm not sure I will have the time, code space, or processing power to make that happen with this project. Technically this is a 'security hole', but honestly I'm not sure there is much risk for this type of device. SensorNode is meant to be installed locally, behind your existing Firewall, and it is ONLY meant to communicate with your install of Home Assistant on the same local network (you can set the URI in the settings). Also, SensorNode is a 'One-Way' device - that is, it is not meant to be talked to. There is no machine-machine input interface of any kind. Yes, it does create a WiFi Access Point for configuration, but this requires someone to gain physical access to put SensorNode into AP mode. So, it would be very difficult if not impossible for a Bad Actor to hack into a SensorNode. Someone could, theoretically, snoop the local network to see what SensorNode is transmitting, but they would have to gain access to the network by some other means. </p><p>I would prefer to implement HTTPS communication for SensorNode, but I'm just not sure I can do it a this time. However, since the code will be open-sourced, perhaps someone else will do it.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Standard-Disclaimer-about-DIY-Projects">Standard Disclaimer about DIY Projects</h4><p><span class="bold">First and foremost, I don't want anyone to get hurt. So be warned - this is NOT a Consumer Product. Since this is a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) project, it's imperative that you understand the risks. All DIY Electronic projects require the user to have basic knowledge about circuits, power, construction techniques like soldering, etc., so they and those around them do not get hurt. So, if you don't understand how to handle yourself around open circuits and power, please don't use this project. There are NO warranties with this type of project.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks" id="risks-and-challenges"><h2 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h2><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">Standard risks apply, but the following seem the most significant:

- TARIFFS - This is in my opinion the most significant risk. As we all are aware, recent political issues have arisen that make it much more difficult to predict costs of sourcing components from China. As such, there is a significant risk that, when ready to fulfill, my costs may be MUCH higher than anticipated. I hope this is not the case, but if it happens, I'll try my best to absorb the costs. But there will be limits to this approach. This may cause significant delays while I wait for costs to come down. As of this writing, costs appear to be manageable. I've added a small buffer to some of the more expensive items in anticipation of minor tariff charges. Let's hope things don't get any worse.

- This is my first Kickstarter, so I don't know what I don't know. I've commercialized many products in my career, but never before have I done it all alone.

- Supply-chain issues. If some component suddenly becomes unavailable, or the price goes through the roof (see TARIFF info above), I may not be able to provide the rewards exactly as specified in the time frame allotted. If this were to happen, I would do whatever I could to deliver those rewards which are unaffected first. If I need to substitute a part, most likely a small redesign will be necessary which will delay reward delivery. If that happens, I'll let everyone know. Most all parts are commodity, so I anticipate at most a few weeks delay. The one glaring exception is the Raspberry Pi Pico W; if I can't get sufficient quantities of that part, or if it's price suddenly explodes, that could be an unrecoverable problem. But the Raspberry Pi foundation has a good track record of managing their supply chain, so I view this as a small risk.

- Home Assistant issues. If, for some reason, Home Assistant decides to deprecate or change any of the interfaces used by SensorNode, then there may be issues. However, since the code will be open-sourced, the community could come up with a solution even without me.

- Success - Wait: What? You better believe it. In this type of project, success is a much bigger 'risk' than failure. Think about it - I'm a one-man band. Even with a supplier making most of the reward, I still need to do work and therefore represent a bottleneck, especially to delivering high quantities on time. I can basically fulfill approximately 100 orders every 2-4 weeks at best. What if I get a MILLION orders? I agree...this is highly unlikely, but nevertheless...it's possible so I thought I'd add it here. This is the main reason I've limited the quantities on all rewards.

- I could get hit by a bus (or simply keel over). I am retired and who knows what could happen. Again, however, I'm planning on open-sourcing the code so I should not have to be around or even involved for the system to live on.</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-commitments" id="environmentalCommitments"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Environmental commitments</h2><span><span class="ksr-green-700">Visit our Environmental Resources Center</span> to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.</span></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Long-lasting design</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">This kit, if built properly, is designed to work for years.

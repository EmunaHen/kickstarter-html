<p><span class="bold">Introducing HACL Air Compressors! </span>Our sealed, closed-loop systems deliver clean, efficient compressed air indoors or out. Unlike traditional systems that vent wastefully after each use, HACL compressors retain and recirculate the air... keeping it clean, dry, and significantly reducing energy use.</p><p><span class="bold">🌀 Closed-loop technology</span><br/><span class="bold">💨 clean, dry compressed air</span><br/><span class="bold">⚡Over 50% energy savings</span><br/><span class="bold">🛠️ Zero maintenance</span><br/><span class="bold">💧 Fully sealed</span><br/><span class="bold">🌧️ indoor &amp; outdoor use.</span></p>
<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:What-can-you-do-with-HACL-Compressors-"><span class="bold">What can you do with HACL Compressors?</span></h3><p>Hybrid Automation Closed-Loop (HACL) compressors are highly versatile and suitable for a wide variety of applications. Although originally developed for controlling pipeline valves, their use extends far beyond that. In essence, any application that involves a closed-loop compatible actuator is a candidate for an HACL system to deliver compressed air efficiently and cleanly.</p><p>HACL compressors are compatible with nearly all common actuator types, including linear, rotary, piston, and diaphragm models. They support both single-acting and double-acting mechanisms and can be customized to accommodate unique or specialized actuator designs.

<p>At Hybrid Automation Inc., our patented compressor systems are built on the principle of <span class="bold">closed-loop air flow</span>—a highly efficient method where <span class="bold">air remains contained within the system at all times</span>, unlike traditional systems that vent or exhaust air during operation. This closed-loop approach delivers several key advantages in performance, maintenance, and energy savings.</p><p>Because the air is <span class="bold">continuously recirculated</span>, it stays <span class="bold">clean and dry</span>, significantly reducing filtering requirements. Air only needs to be filtered during the <span class="bold">initial charge</span> and on rare occasions during automatic recharging. With proper use, <span class="bold">filters will not need to be replaced or cleaned</span> for the life of the product.</p><p>To maintain consistent pressure, the system includes an <span class="bold">automatic recharge function</span> that compensates for minor air leaks. When actuators are connected using proper assembly techniques, leakage is minimal and the recharge is rarely required.</p><p>One of the most impactful benefits of closed-loop air flow is <span class="bold">energy efficiency</span>. Our system can reduce the energy required to power most pneumatic actuators <span class="bold">50-60%</span>, without sacrificing performance. Instead of venting pressure to zero when an actuator moves to its depressurized position, our system <span class="bold">equalizes pressure across both sides of the actuator</span> while maintaining a higher baseline pressure. This reduces the energy needed for the next actuation cycle, since the system is transitioning from a partially pressurized state rather than starting from zero. The result is <span class="bold">significant energy savings</span>, grounded in the <span class="bold">first law of thermodynamics</span>.</p><p>Hybrid Automation’s closed-loop systems are designed specifically to <span class="bold">power pneumatic actuators with maximum efficiency and minimal maintenance</span>, delivering clean, consistent performance without compromise.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="Closed loop compressor system vs traditional open system" data-caption="Comparison of closed loop compressor system vs. traditional open system. " data-id="49162716">

<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Reduced-Charging-Time-and-Energy-Savings"><span class="bold">Reduced Charging Time and Energy Savings</span></h3><p>Closed-loop air flow minimizes the time and energy required to charge a pneumatic system after each operation of an actuator. Compared to traditional venting systems, tanks can be fully charged in about half the time, while the compressor consumes 50% (or less) energy. The graph below compares the performance of a typical pneumatic system using both a traditional venting setup versus a closed-loop system.</p><p>While the fundamental thermodynamic energy savings of closed-loop systems are substantial, additional efficiencies can also be realized. Traditional compressor setups, which rely on large central compressors and extended piping to reach each actuator, often suffer significant air loss through leaks and frictional drag as air moves through the pipes. On average, industrial facilities lose an estimated 30% of compressed air to leaks alone. Furthermore, maintaining these large-scale systems incurs considerable cost and energy. By contrast, small closed-loop HACL systems, installed directly at the actuator, minimize or eliminate pipeline and system losses—drastically improving both energy efficiency and operational costs.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="energy saving air compressor" data-caption="Graph showing how energy is saved using closed loop system." data-id="49016174">

The existing solutions were costly, inefficient, and often unreliable in vibration prone or high temperature applications. We saw an opportunity to harness the power of air—an abundant, cost-effective, and naturally fail-safe resource—to create a closed-loop fail-safe pneumatic controller. Our vision was clear: develop a solution that not only delivered higher power at a lower cost but also offered superior safety and reliability.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="48720436">

<p>As Managing Director of Hybrid Automation Inc., Bob Connal is the company’s founder and IP developer. In February 2022, the US Patent Office issued a Patent for nineteen of his twenty claims.</p><p>Determined to bring this concept to life, we poured our efforts into research and development, engineering multiple prototypes, refining our design, and testing our technology rigorously. Once we had working prototypes, we hit the road, traveling across the country, attending trade shows, and engaging directly with industry professionals. The response was overwhelmingly positive, but it was on this journey that we discovered something even bigger—an application that could change the environmental impact of the oil and gas sector.</p><p>For decades, oil and gas producers used methane directly from wells to power pneumatic devices.   The highly toxic green-house gas, methane, was vented directly to atmosphere.  Recent environmental regulations including EPA Reg. 40 CFR 60 and Quad-O b/c directives require existing and new well pads convert methane powered pneumatics to a zero emissions system.  Our system presented a seamless alternative: a plug-and-play replacement that could eliminate methane emissions while maintaining, or even improving, operational efficiency. The ability to swap out a polluting system with a clean, air-powered one was a game-changer.</p><p>However, as a small company, we faced significant roadblocks. The major oil and gas producers demanded a proven track record—something difficult to establish when we were the first of our kind. Despite this challenge, we pressed forward. We secured opportunities to speak at industry conventions, generated excitement with our trade show booths, and most importantly, placed trial units in the field. Those trials led to our first sale—proof that system was not just an idea, but a viable, working solution.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="outdoor rated air compressor" data-caption="Hybrid Automation enclosures are tough and can be installed virtually anywhere. " data-id="48750676">

<p>As we continued to refine our technology, we recognized that the potential of Hybrid Automation extended far beyond oil and gas. Any industry relying on pneumatic actuators could benefit from our system. Our closed-loop air system reduces maintenance and conserves a significant amount of energy. These advantages make our device a smart investment for businesses and a meaningful step toward a more sustainable future.</p><p>Now, we stand at a pivotal moment. With a strong foundation of interest and initial success, we want to take Hybrid Automation to the next level—offering our closed-loop compressor systems to the masses and expanding their applications across industries. By supporting our Kickstarter campaign, you’re not just backing a product; you’re supporting a shift towards cleaner, more efficient pneumatic actuation.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:History-of-Development">History of Development</h3><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Concepts-and-Early-Testing-">Concepts and Early Testing.</h4><p>In the early stages at Hybrid Automation, our focus was on exploring core concepts and experimenting with various system architectures. We conducted extensive testing, both with and without tanks, and evaluated the performance of both two-position and modulating actuators. Our team also carried out reliability assessments and pump speed trials to refine our designs. One of our key achievements achieved during this period was demonstrating the energy-saving potential of closed-loop systems. Additionally, we worked to optimize component selection and manufacturing processes to improve efficiency and scalability.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="closed loop air compressor design process" data-caption="Bench tests and early prototype development." data-id="48778079">

These events proved invaluable—not only did they help us build visibility, but they also opened the door to meaningful conversations with key players in the field. Their feedback validated our approach and gave us new insights into what the market truly needed.</p><p>During this time, we successfully sold our first system, a major milestone that confirmed we were on the right track. We also began receiving a wide range of requests for custom applications. It quickly became clear that adaptability would be essential. In response, we shifted our focus toward making the system more modular. This allowed us to meet varied demands with greater ease, while also making the design more scalable and efficient to manufacture. What started as a fixed prototype evolved into a flexible, user-focused platform ready for broader adoption.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="Closed Loop Air Compressor" data-caption="Shipped tankless unit with internal pressure switch and flow control." data-id="48765596">

</div>
<p><span class="bold">How It Works</span><br/>To operate, simply connect the power leads to a 12V DC battery or other power source with adequate capacity. The compressor will automatically start and begin delivering air through the high-pressure output tube. While running, the compressor draws in air through the low-pressure tube—this is the core of the closed-loop function. This tube is designed to connect to the exhaust ports of your pneumatic devices and flow control valves, allowing the system to reclaim and reuse exhaust air rather than venting it. This function significantly improves energy efficiency compared to conventional open systems.</p><p><span class="bold">Initial Charging &amp; Self-Recharge</span><br/>When first powered on, the compressor performs an initial charging cycle. During this process, ambient air is drawn in, filtered, and dried to ensure the internal system is filled with clean, dry air. If a pressure drop later occurs—whether from small leaks or natural permeation—the system will automatically recharge in the same way. Although the compressor can tolerate minor leaks, maintaining tight, leak-free connections will help maximize performance and extend the system’s lifespan.</p><p><span class="bold">Versatility &amp; Expandability</span><br/>HACL compressor systems are compatible with a wide range of pneumatic components, including pressure vessels, actuators, flow control valves, and any other device capable of operating in a closed-loop configuration. Multiple HACL units can also be connected together to increase capacity or add redundancy, allowing for flexible integration in a variety of applications.  If backers have any questions about how to set up and use their systems, we are happy to assist and are here to help.</p><p><span class="bold">Durability by Design</span><br/>Each system is enclosed in a rugged enclosure that's fully sealed against water and dust.  Built for durability and suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. Installation is straightforward, and the compact design ensures a clean and professional setup.</p><p>We’re grateful for your support and can’t wait to see how you use your HACL compressor systems.

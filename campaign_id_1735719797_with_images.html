Launching GaragX is an ambitious project—and like any new venture, it comes with challenges.
One of the main challenges we face is the regulatory environment.
Spain has one of the most complex and demanding sets of laws and regulations for businesses in Europe. This makes the process of opening, certifying, and operating a creative tech space slower and more expensive than in other countries.
However, this is not a weakness—it's our strength.
If we can successfully launch GaragX here, in one of the toughest environments for new business growth, we are confident we can replicate and scale the model anywhere in the world with greater speed and efficiency.
Other potential risks include:
Construction delays due to permits or supply issues
Higher-than-expected costs for regulatory compliance and equipment
Initial community growth may take time as we build awareness and trust in a brand-new concept

How we are addressing these risks:
We have already started building and securing key equipment to stay ahead of delays.
We are working with local experts to navigate regulations efficiently.
We have a strategic marketing and outreach plan to accelerate community growth from day one.
At GaragX, we believe that big dreams come with big challenges—and overcoming them makes us even stronger.
We are fully committed to transparency, adaptability, and smart, sustainable growth.</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Use of AI</h2></div><div class="border-bottom mb2"><p>🤖 Empowering the Future: AI Education at GaragX
At GaragX, we believe AI is not just the future—it’s the present.
We will teach our community how to use, understand, and develop with Artificial Intelligence, from practical everyday tools to building custom AI applications.
Our goal is to make AI accessible to everyone, empowering creators to innovate, automate, and lead in the new digital era.</p></div><div class="mt5"><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about AI policy on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-commitments" id="environmentalCommitments"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Environmental commitments</h2><span><span class="ksr-green-700">Visit our Environmental Resources Center</span> to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.</span></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Long-lasting design</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">� Building for the Long Term: The Power of Community
GaragX is not a short-term project—it’s a long-term vision built to grow, evolve, and thrive with time.
The true strength and sustainability of GaragX come from its community. Every member, every creator, every innovator adds to the collective knowledge, energy, and possibilities of what we can achieve together.
A strong community means power:
Power to create, to share, to innovate, and to transform ideas into real impact.
As GaragX grows, the community becomes an unstoppable force—driving new projects, inspiring new leaders, and opening doors to bigger opportunities around the world.
At GaragX, we’re not just building spaces. We’re building a movement.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Reusability and recyclability</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">♻️ Turning Waste into Wisdom:
GaragX’s Commitment to Sustainable Learning
At GaragX, technology isn’t just something you use. it’s something you understand, repair, and reinvent.
That’s why we proudly integrate used and damaged devices into our learning process. Instead of letting valuable materials go to waste, we transform them into powerful educational tools. Our members learn how technology works from the inside out, gaining hands-on skills in diagnosis, repair, upgrading, and creative reuse.
This approach not only builds real-world tech skills—it fosters a culture of sustainability and innovation, where every device gets a second life and every learner becomes a creator.
By teaching recycling through action, GaragX is shaping a smarter, greener, and more resourceful generation of tech leaders.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Sustainable materials</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">� Sustainability at the Heart of GaragX
At GaragX, sustainability is a core value. We are committed to using eco-friendly, sustainable materials wherever possible in our spaces and projects. From recycled building materials to energy-efficient equipment, we ensure that every step we take is aligned with our mission to create a greener, more responsible future.

By using sustainable resources, we not only reduce our environmental impact, but we also teach our community to be mindful creators—building a future where innovation and sustainability go hand in hand.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span>Questions about this project? </span><span class="bold link-blue type-16">Check out the FAQ</span></div></div><div id="report-this-project"><span class="kds-button kds-button">Report this project to Kickstarter</span></div></div>

<p>Late in 2020, and deep into the pandemic, it became increasingly apparent that there were more moments I wanted to save for myself than I wanted to share on social media. At this point in my life, I had nearly two decades of memories logged on social platforms that I couldn’t really search, and there were significant life moments happening that didn’t belong on public display. Moments that didn’t need to be validated by likes or comments, just details of my life I wanted to be able to access again.<br/><br/>By early 2021, the idea for striing started to take shape—a mobile platform to capture and document the details of your life. The following year Danielle Daugherty joined as my Co-Founder and COO. Danielle brings nearly a decade of business operations experience to striing, having held roles in community engagement, HR and strategy consulting. </p><p>Together, we focused on our customer messaging and our pitch, as well as the foundational elements of becoming a real company. We’ve participated in numerous pitch competitions and other accelerator-type programming, which all ultimately came back to the same thesis—”build it, gain traction and then come back and talk to us.” In 2024 we built our prototype (via Figma) and this year we plan to build and launch the first version of the platform with the funds raised from this Kickstarter.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49698173">

One main timeline houses all of your posts, with smaller, more hyper-focused timelines called Collections. You might have a collection of your significant other, all of the books you've read, your professional portfolio, memories and papers from college, or keeping track of your high scores on video games. A place to put all of the drawings from your kiddos or to track your journey as an entrepreneur to quickly recall everything you've accomplished.</p><p>striing provides structure to keep everything in one place and makes it easy to organize and rediscover. It gives you a place to put quotes from those late night conversations with family and friends or to note all of the cool cars you've come across. With striing, everything is private by default, and from there you get to decide who, if anyone, you want to share Collections with. Enjoy public Collections of your movie reviews and photography while maintaining Collections for certain eyes only. </p><p>There is a 100+ year old principle called the forgetting curve that says we forget up to 90% of our experiences after just seven days. Think back to one week ago—what do you remember? What are we willing to risk forgetting?</p><p>Keep reading to learn about the key elements that will be included in the first version of the striing platform.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49698245">

You might have a collection of your relationship, your business, your art portfolio, every book you’ve read, every vacation you’ve gone on, your stamp collection, etc. Some Collections you may want to have completely public, like your music collection or business accomplishments.

<h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Blips"><span class="bold">Blips</span></h4><p><span class="bold">Blips</span> are single-frame posts and are typically used for capturing quick or small moments. For example, you may want to remember a funny joke or take a short video that wouldn’t warrant a larger post. Blips can be a still image, video, or blank background. Blips have both a published date, as well as an adjustable date to ensure it falls at the right date on your timeline.

<h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Photo-Albums"><span class="bold">Photo Albums</span></h4><p>A <span class="bold">Photo album</span> is a way to collect a lot of photos in one place.

Hashtags can be included on any Entry, Blip, or Photo Album. So for example, if you searched #FunnyMoments, you'd find every post where you included that tag. #ProudMoments, #CoolCars, #Pacers, #DailyRun, #GoodIdeas… suddenly we can categorize life quickly and conveniently—all in one place.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49262522">

<h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Connections"><span class="bold">Connections</span></h4><p><span class="bold">Connections</span> are other users you are connected to on striing. If a user is not a connection of yours, they can only see anything on your profile that is completely public. If a user is a connection of yours, you may choose to add them to various groups (only visible to you) to make it easier for sharing posts with others. For example, you may have a group called “College Friends” that you may want to share similar posts with, instead of sharing it with the same individual people every time. </p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Our-Business-Model"><span class="bold">Our Business Model</span></h4><p>Users get a small amount of space to use to see if striing is the right solution for them.

<p><span class="text-italic">Team brainstorming retreat April 2022.</span></p><p><img class="image"/></p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:passion-and-vision"><span class="bold">passion and vision</span></h3><p>After working on striing for 5 years, I’m still surprised how many times I organically wish that striing existed. As I write this, I’m sitting in my friend’s backyard, watching the ducks hang out on the dock as the high, fast-moving river flows by, and there’s no good way to capture this moment. A photo alone in my camera roll loses meaning and relevance over time. As Danielle says, time is a nonrenewable resource, and we need a place to capture how to spend it. From watching ducks and spending time with friends, to starting companies or moving to a different state. Everyone deserves a place to watch your kids grow up, keep the epic fishing trips and car restoration photos. The wedding albums and trunks of old memories and home videos. A place to keep track of video game scores and health journeys. To keep recipes and capture old memories. Everyday, there are so many details in our lives that are worth remembering. It’s unacceptable that we forget so many things after just 7 days.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49696917">

<p>"striing would help me keep both my thoughts and content organized, especially with starting a business. I've tried multiple solutions for cataloging, tagging, and sharing photos, videos, and notes over the years but they all had a high learning curve, cost a lot of money, or didn't work with my setup. I just need a simple solution that works across platforms and doesn't require much effort to learn while not breaking the bank which is why striing is on my radar." <span class="bold">—Ron D.</span>, 40</p><p>"I’d want Striing to exist because it would make it so much easier to remember the good times, express creativity, and document the meaningful chapters of life—like my move from Indiana to Florida.

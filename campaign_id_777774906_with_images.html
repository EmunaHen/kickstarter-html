<p>One day soon we’ll move beyond the phone or the laptop. There will be new devices, probably a few, that let us use AI in a more fun and natural way. Some of those will be awesome. But you don't have to wait for someone else to invent that for you. <span class="bold">You can</span> <span class="bold">build your own prototype</span> <span class="bold">today</span>. You can make a pirate GPT. <br/><br/>With about $25 in parts, you can give any stuffed animal the full intelligence of an AI model. This takes no technical skill - just scissors and sewing - and only about 15 minutes. You pair it to your phone and use a voice AI app like ChatGPT to begin speaking with it.<br/><br/>You can build an owl or a parrot that sits perched on your shoulder (we've included instructions for a simple shoulder mount). Or maybe a stuffed monkey that hangs from your backpack. It could also be something totally different, like a scarf or cozy blanket. Bundle yourself in it and have a quiet conversation.    </p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Why-it-might-be-awesome"><span class="bold">Why it might be awesome</span></h4><p><span class="bold">1) You get to choose the animal </span>or object<span class="bold">.</span> It can be a stuffed animal you already love, and now you can give it intelligence. Or you can find and buy a new toy. It can be a tiny bird or a giant stuffed bear to buy and build from. Almost anything can be a pirate GPT.<br/>  <br/><span class="bold">2) You get to make it yourself.</span> Making is different from buying things, even when the making is simple. Pirate GPTs only require some easy cutting and sewing. Anyone can do it in about 15 minutes. If you make it, you'll feel differently about it.     <br/><br/><span class="bold">3) Your idea might become the best idea.</span> We're at this funny window in tech history where the next wearable or AI hasn't yet been figured out. Will it be a stuffed pet, a piece of clothing, an accessory? You should certainly decide for yourself, but it also may inspire many others.   </p>
<h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:-Let-s-get-started-">
<br/><span class="bold">Let's get started</span> </h4><p>We've posted the instructions and videos for free on Reddit (see below), along and a list of parts. But whatever you need and start building. You DO NOT need to back this Kickstarter to make a pirate GPT. But once you do build something, we encourage you to post it and show everyone your idea. <br/>     <br/><span class="bold">Free instructions and videos</span>: <span>https://www.reddit.com/r/PirateGPTs/</span> <br/><br/>If this is all terribly exciting to you,<span class="bold"> consider backing this Kickstarter for only $3</span>. For $3 you will get a STICKER, which is kind of cool. Maybe we'll also add something extra. It's an easy way to show your support.  <br/><br/>We've also built a few pirate GPTs which you can buy, owls and parrots mostly. We're not making many because it's SOOOO much better to build your own. But they are here if you're a super motivated supporter! (We apologize if they are sold out by the time you read this.) </p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:All-the-fun-details-"><span class="bold">All the fun details  </span></h4><p>Here's how this thing began.     <br/>    <br/>I was having Mother's Day brunch in Berkeley with my family, sitting outside in the mid-morning sun. My daughter Clare looked over my shoulder and said, “My gosh that’s a beautiful bird.” I turned around and there was a woman with a green parrot on her shoulder. Clare said, “For a second, I thought it was an AI.”</p><p>I had no idea what she meant.</p><p>“I thought it was some device, a wearable AI parrot on her shoulder. She could walk around and ask it questions, like ChatGPT.”</p><p>“Tech companies keep building AI glasses and headsets I’m not going to wear in public. They're totally unattractive. They’re not cool. But a parrot...that’s cool.”</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="two people with wearable AI parrots " data-id="49580258">

<p>We talked a bit more. I finally got it. <br/><br/>“Wait, I think we can build that pretty easily. We probably have most of the parts around the house." <br/><br/>But we didn't have any parrots. So, still at the table, we ordered a 3-pack of parrots (stuffed) from Amazon. <br/><br/>When they arrived a few days later, it took less than 30 minutes to make our prototype: a pirate-voiced parrot, perched comfortably on your shoulder that let you talk to ChatGPT.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="parrot v.1 with shoulder magnet, charging cable, x-acto knife" data-id="49495647">

<p>There were so many obvious and fun applications: you could make dinner and get helpful cooking advice, repair a bicycle with an expert mechanic perched on your shoulder, study history with the encyclopedia advice of helpful tutor. All of this without pulling out a phone or staring at a screen. You had access to the full intelligence of this model in a warm and fuzzy form factor.    </p><p>But there was something bigger. Talking to a soft, stuffed animal with a face changed everything. We were asking different questions, listening differently. Somehow this little hack felt like leap.       <br/><br/>We ordered a few more stuffed animals - a monkey, a cute little owl, a capybara with a turtle backpack. Over the next few days they all underwent surgery. </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="gpt candidates, pre-op" data-id="49508359">

<p>Each creature taught us something different. Each one provoked a slightly different response from our imagination. <br/><br/>We ordered the monkey because it hung around your neck, a new and unexpected wearable! But it was <span class="bold">the primate face that drew us in</span>. As we chatted with the AI, we found ourselves turning its head to look into its eyes, talking directly to it.      <br/><br/>We also made a little blue bird, one the fit in the cup of your hand. You <span class="bold">treat it very gently because of its size</span>. You talk to it more quietly. Perched on your shoulder, it disappears from your peripheral view, and becomes a little birdy in your ear.     <br/><br/>Most recently, we did a giant five-foot bear. After setting it up, my daughter <span class="bold">flopped down on top of it</span> and started a conversation about 19th century art history. Before seeing that, I had never thought about giving an AI a big hug.      <br/><br/>Collectively, it was obvious that people should get a shot at creating and playing with forms that THEY liked. Maybe they had a stuffed animal they loved. Maybe they want to explore non-creature forms: <span class="bold">a cozy blanket</span> that you could wrap around yourself and ask all the questions of life, or <span class="bold">a talking hat</span> to chat with on an evening walk.   </p><p>Pirate GPTs is about you getting to build what’s most interesting to you. <br/><br/>Hopefully, it also becomes a community of people who want to build and share their own prototypes. We've set-up the Reddit so people can do that.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:-1-FAQ-are-pirate-gpts-for-adults-or-kids-"><span class="bold">#1 FAQ: are pirate gpts for adults or kids?</span></h4><p>We recommend this for adults. Or at least an AI-experienced adult alongside their kid. One benefit of making a pirate gpt as an adult is you'll probably spend more time playing with AI. You'll understand what it's capable of, where you find it useful or virtuous in your life, where you don't. There's really no way to fully understand AI by reading about AI, you need hours of first-person experience. A light bulb goes off, and then you see probably see the future a bit differently.</p><p>Once you've done that, you can decide how you want to use it with your child. It may be great for studying or creating stories together or telling jokes. Either way, our guidance is that you ride alongside them during in this experience. It will be good for both of you.<br/><br/><span class="bold">How Pirate GPTs work </span></p><p>These are built with off-the-shelf components you can purchase on Amazon. Most of the other tools you'll need for assembly can probably be found around the house (needle, thread, x-acto knife or razor).  <br/><br/><span class="bold">1. Parrot or Owl. </span>This is a standard stuffed parrot or owl. We've tried a bunch of other animals but these is particularly charming because they perch on your shoulder. <br/><br/><span class="bold">2. Mic and Speaker.</span> This is small bluetooth device that's used for hands-free phone calls. We've repurposed it for the bird internals. Good quality ones range from $15-$70, and we've tested the full range. Details on the Reddit. Installing in the parrot is a very minor surgery. After closing the incision, you leave a small opening for the charging cable (see note 5).    </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="the internals, simplified" data-id="49589732">

<p><span class="bold">3. Perching mechanism (optional). </span>A magnet is installed at the base of the bird. Another magnet rests on your shoulder, under your shirt. You can make an elastic strap which makes it more steady. The magnets pull at about 65 lbs, so when paired the parrot it holds quite well. It also works better sitting on a table with a weighted, magnet base.  <br/><br/><span class="bold">4. Pairing with Chat. </span>This bird pairs with ChatGPT in voice mode on your phone. You only need to set up a free account. You can use any other AI voice software. As the software and models get better, so does your parrot. <br/><br/><span class="bold">5. Charging.</span> There is a USB-C cable included to easily recharge your bird. It can talk for 10-12 hours on a single charge, so this is probably an infrequent activity.      <br/><br/><span class="bold">6. Advanced configurations. </span>You can have it speak in a pirate voice by saying, "speak in a pirate voice." You can ask it to whisper. You can give it any other instructions just by saying them verbally. If you want more permanent features, you can set custom instructions. (If you're even more technically inclined, you can probably do something awesome with an API.)       <br/><br/><span class="bold">7. Simpler configurations.</span> It's even simpler to build animals who do NOT perch. You can skip the magnet or the perching mechanism, and only install the Mic and Speaker. We've built a monkey that hangs around your neck, smaller stuffed animals that sit on your desk. The giant five-foot teddy bear falls into this camp (it also has a pre-installed zipper, so no sewing!) <br/><br/>You can find detailed instructions and links to supplies on Reddit. <br/><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span>https://www.reddit.com/r/PirateGPTs/</span> &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/><br/><span class="bold">Constraints and Known Issues</span><br/><br/>- Phone Distance. Since your phone is the source of the AI, that needs to stay within Bluetooth range of your parrot, usually about 30 feet. Given our close connection to our phones, this should be a non-issue.    <br/><br/>- Minor latency. Bluetooth adds a small amount of latency to interacting with Chat or another AI app. Most users will not notice it.   <br/><br/><span class="bold">The Serious Part </span><br/><br/><span class="bold">1. To learn about AI you really should play with AI. </span>We're all feeling around in the dark to understand what's possible with AI and what's ultimately useful to people. This is an act of discovery (like science), maybe even creation (like art). Voice mode is a particularly easy way to play with it.   <br/><br/><span class="bold">2. Get a break from metal, glass and screen. </span>The current interfaces are a bit too pervasive in our lives. Our eyes and hands needs a break. Playing with a soft, fuzzy, stuffed computer is a nice relief.    <br/><br/><span class="bold">3. Build something yourself.</span> Making anything gives you more insight than just buying it. This is a very simple project, but I promise that you'll get something valuable from building it yourself. Technology is tools. It should nudge us to make things. AI has a huge potential to help non-technical people be technically enabled, have more agency, and make more things. The alternative is also an option - you can only feel like technology is being imposed upon you. That's probably a choice.          <br/><br/>Wow. Long read. Surprised you made it! Back the project if you can. Let's make this happen.    </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks" id="risks-and-challenges"><h2 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h2><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">We have already built 5 successful prototypes.

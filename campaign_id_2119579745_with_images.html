<li>
<span class="bold">Development Challenges:</span> Creating reliable and efficient local AI is a complex process. We aim to bring in an experienced team that will work using agile development methodologies to promptly address issues and make changes.</li>
<li>
<span class="bold">Delivery Timelines: </span>Unforeseen factors can always affect timelines. We commit to providing regular updates and being as transparent as possible about any delays, maintaining open dialogue.</li>
<li>
<span class="bold">Funding: </span>Not reaching the full funding goal might impact the development speed of some features. However, we have a clear plan for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that will be delivered regardless of the funding level.</li>
</ul><p>We are committed to maximum transparency in communication and are confident in our ability to overcome these challenges through dedication to our cause and the support of our community.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks" id="risks-and-challenges"><h2 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h2><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">Creating an innovative software product, especially one based on complex technologies like Local AI, always comes with certain risks. We want to be completely transparent with you, our potential backers. Here are the main risks and challenges we have identified and our plans to overcome them:

1. Technical Challenges and AI Optimization: Developing AI that works efficiently and quickly locally on a variety of computer configurations (both old and new, on Windows and macOS) is a challenging task. It may require significant optimization to achieve the desired performance and recognition accuracy on different hardware.
* How ​​we overcome this:  We build enough time into the development schedule for thorough testing and performance optimization. Our future professional developers have experience with complex calculations and code optimization. We also plan to roll out features in stages to ensure that the core functionality is stable first.

2. The Difficulty of Moving from MVP to Commercial Product: Our MVP has proven the viability of the concept, but turning it into a robust, fully functional, and user-friendly commercial product requires significant effort and expertise that (as a visionary) I do not yet have in full.
* How ​​we are overcoming this: The main goal of this crowdfunding campaign is to raise funds specifically to attract a highly skilled team of professional developers who have the necessary experience in building robust software and working with AI. Your support will directly help us form this team and provide the necessary resources for successful development.

3. Development and Reward Delivery Timelines: Despite careful planning, software development sometimes faces unforeseen delays. This may affect the planned release dates of the product and, consequently, the delivery of rewards (access to the program).
* **How ​​we overcome this:** We strive to set realistic deadlines for our campaign. In case of any delays, we are committed to maintaining **transparent and timely communication** with all backers, explaining the reasons and informing about the new approximate schedule. We understand the importance of trust and will do everything possible to deliver the product as soon as possible without compromising quality.

4. Ensuring Compatibility and Support for Different OSes: Ensuring stable operation on both operating systems (Windows and macOS) and their constantly updated versions is a challenge that requires regular testing and adaptation.
How ​​we overcome this: We plan to pay significant attention to automated and manual testing on different OS versions and hardware configurations. The campaign funds will also go towards securing the necessary resources for long-term support and product updates after launch.

We are confident in our ability to overcome these challenges with your support and the right expertise. We are committed to building a high-quality product that truly solves the problem and respects your privacy. Thank you for your trust!</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Use of AI</h2></div><div class="border-bottom mb2"><h3 class="normal type-18">My project seeks funding for AI technology.</h3></div><div class="border-bottom mb2"><h3 class="normal type-18 mt5">I am incorporating AI in my project in another way.</h3><p>My project, "PhotoAI Navigator," uses artificial intelligence technology as the "fundamental foundation" for its work. The AI ​​is implemented to "locally analyze and catalog digital photos directly on users' computers (Windows/macOS)".

AI models allow the program to "understand" the content of photos (objects, scenes, activities) so that users can perform intelligent searches based on text descriptions ("cat on the couch", "birthday", "mountains in summer") and automatically organize their collection.

The Kickstarter fundraising "is aimed at finalizing and professionally developing" this key AI functionality by a qualified team of developers. This will allow for a stable, efficient and commercially ready product.

It is important to emphasize: the AI ​​in "PhotoAI Navigator" processes "photos that belong to the user himself", while maintaining complete "privacy". All computations occur "locally on the user's device" and data is "never transmitted to external servers" for analysis. The project **does not use external third-party content databases** for processing in the app (although the underlying AI models may be pre-trained on publicly available data, which is standard practice), so the consent or attribution requirements mentioned above do not apply to data processed by our app after a user installs it.

The use of AI is a key "other way" to implement technology to provide a unique value proposition - powerful organization and search of photos with privacy guarantees.</p></div><div class="mt5"><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about AI policy on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span>Questions about this project? </span><span class="bold link-blue type-16">Check out the FAQ</span></div></div><div id="report-this-project"><span class="kds-button kds-button">Report this project to Kickstarter</span></div></div>

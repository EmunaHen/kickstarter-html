This isn't just another job board—it's a specialized ecosystem that connects highly-trained legal minds with employers, recruiters, and consulting firms who value the analytical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and expertise that comes with a graduate degree in the legal field. You don't always need a pipeline of a billion users to find the perfect candidate. </p><p>Our platform will feature intelligent matching algorithms that understand the unique value proposition of JD/LLM degree (among others) and graduating law students, whether they're seeking roles in academia, compliance consulting, policy analysis, corporate strategy, or any of the dozens of career paths where legal training provides a distinct competitive edge. Those seeking traditional legal roles will find those opportunities, as well. </p><p>According to a survey we performed, the number one complaint from job seekers when using traditional job boards is having to re-enter every bit of information that their uploaded resume already contains...so frustrating! The JD Advantage remedies that frustration by utilizing a standard resume format that requires job seekers to input ONCE! Of course it can be edited, but only if you want to. Recruiters and companies seeking candidates like you will use our standardized resumes and applications to connect with candidates...no more manually inputting your job from May 2004 - March 2009 for the zillionth time. Can I get an AMEN?! </p><p><span class="bold">The JD Advantage Benefit</span></p><p>Are you ready to leave the stress and time commitment demanded by your traditional legal career behind? Picture a change of scenery. Imagine working remotely, part-time, or re-entering the workforce with a job you enjoy. Get excited, because The JD Advantage is here to make that happen for YOU! Maybe you've thought about dipping your toe into academia? Perhaps you're curious about using your expertise in a different industry? Well, you've come to the right place. Transform your career!</p><p>For those of you still want to find traditional legal opportunities, we haven't forgotten about you. We will host traditional legal field jobs, as well. We also have plans to create an area focused on legal professionals (paralegals, legal assistants, etc.) in the near future. Maybe you want to leverage your current role into a lateral move.

We give you the ability to market to and engage with candidates who fit your exact needs. </p><p><span class="bold">Why The JD Advantage Matters</span></p><p>Upon earning my JD, after nearly 20 years of professional experience, I found myself explaining to confused recruiters why I didn't necessarily want to practice law but still believed my legal education coupled with my previous professional experience was incredibly valuable. I watched brilliant colleagues who were burned out from the traditional practice of law struggle to translate their skills and expertise into non-traditional careers, often underselling themselves or feeling like they had to completely abandon their legal background. </p><p>The breaking point came when I realized I had been searching for nearly 10 months across multiple job boards, but not feeling like my search results fit precisely what I was desiring. Despite my expertise and analytical skills, I couldn't get past initial screenings because traditional recruiters didn't understand how my background and expertise applied. Meanwhile, organizations were desperately seeking candidates with exactly my skill set—we just didn't know how to find each other. So, we fixed that.</p><p>I realized I'm not the only JD caught in this situation, and that there are countless employers missing out on exceptional talent because the traditional job sites don't know how to connect them.</p><p><span class="bold">The JD Advantage Solution Strategy &amp; Revenue Model</span>:</p><p><span class="bold">Key Partners:</span> Employers, Legal Field &amp; Non-Legal Field Recruiters, Consulting Firms, Job Seekers (JDs/LLMs/3Ls), Law Schools</p><p><span class="bold">Key Activities</span>:  Curated Job Posts, Job Searches, Job Postings, Standardized Resume Submission (you're welcome), Standardized Resume Database, Legal Career Transition Opportunities, CLE Credit (future), Therapy Connection (future)</p><p><span class="bold">Key Resources</span>: Website, App (future), Brand, Reputation, Niche Market</p><p><span class="bold">Value Proposition for Customer Segments</span></p><p><span class="bold">Job Seekers:</span> The JD Advantage will provide those with a JD or LLM (among others) degree a comprehensive platform for finding both alternative employment (non-legal field) and traditional legal field opportunities. Offering CLE will keep traffic coming back every year. Offering a place to find therapists who specialize in working with attorneys will benefit the mental health our users.</p><p><span class="bold">Employers/Consulting Firms:</span> The JD Advantage will offer those seeking employees or consultants an efficient, cost-effective, solution for attracting and hiring qualified candidates with a JD, LLM, and/or a law license.</p><p><span class="bold">Recruiters:</span> The JD Advantage will connect recruiters to a vast network of JD and LLM (among others) degree holding candidates for both alternative (non-legal field/consulting) and traditional legal field opportunities.</p><p><span class="bold">Law Schools/3L Students:</span> Law schools live for metrics (especially that sacred percentage of those who graduate with a job), and graduates need jobs. The JD Advantage will offer students (JD or LLM among others) who may not want to go into law practice or who do not want to take a bar exam, other aligned job opportunities. Again, we will also offer traditional legal field job opportunities for graduates seeking traditional legal field opportunities.</p><p><span class="bold">Customer Relationships</span>: Self-service for all customer segments </p><p><span class="bold">Customer Support:</span> For all customer segments </p><p><span class="bold">Channels:</span> Website, Mobile Site, and App (all are under construction)</p><p><span class="bold">Cost Structure</span>: Infrastructure and platforms (website and app) maintenance, employee costs, advertising and marketing expenses, taxes, miscellaneous business fees (trademarks filing, business entity fees, licensing, etc.), and of course legal advice.</p><p><span class="bold">Revenue Streams:</span> Job Advertising Services, Subscription Levels for both Job Seekers and Job Posters, Resume Database Access, Search by Area of Expertise and Degree Type</p><p><span class="bold">Who I Am?</span></p><p>I'm Angie Barker, JD (of course), and I've lived this challenge of searching but not finding non-traditional legal work. After earning my JD, and with a focus in a niche area of property law, I discovered my passion lay in the intersection of regulatory compliance and policy rather than traditional litigation practice. Prior to obtaining my JD, I spent nearly twenty years in compliance consulting, leveraging my skills to help lenders, housing authorities, and property management companies navigate ADA and Fair Housing regulatory challenges.</p><p>My background combines legal training with practical consulting experience—I've seen both sides of this hiring gap. I understand what makes someone with a JD an exceptional employee, and I know what employers are really looking for when they say they want "someone who thinks like a lawyer" but don't need traditional legal services.</p><p><span class="bold">The Opportunity Ahead</span></p><p>The legal education market is ripe for disruption. With law school debt averaging $170,000 and traditional legal employment becoming increasingly exclusive and competitive, JD graduates need other pathways to career success. Simultaneously, employers across industries are recognizing the value of a trained legal mind in roles from compliance to strategy to risk management.</p><p>The JD Advantage is not just a job platform—it’s a movement that recognizes those with a JD/LLM are versatile, analytical professionals and The JD Advantage can help both job seekers and recruiters/employers connect. </p><p><span class="bold">Timeline</span></p><p>We are on track to launch in October of 2025, sooner, if possible. Our website is almost finished, with beta testing imminent. Our app is in the "permission" stage (Apple &amp; Android). </p><p><span class="bold">Future Plans (within 12 months of launch):</span> <span class="bold">If you're still reading, thank you! We hope to add other legal professional jobs, web-based continuing legal education options, and an area for licensed therapists who specialize in the issues legal professionals often face, to connect with clients who need their help.

We hope to foster that connection.  </span></p><p><span class="bold">Your support will help us bridge this gap and unlock the potential of legal minds ready to make their mark beyond the courtroom!</span></p><p>Thanks for your support!!</p><p><span class="text-italic">*Total Funding Goal: $585,000 to cover platform development, initial marketing, and operations for the first year.

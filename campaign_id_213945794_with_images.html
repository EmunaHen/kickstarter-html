Destination inspiration, in-app hotel &amp; flight booking, build followers, earn revenue, wishlist destinations, direct message, review and so, so much more. Neuraa aims to be a one of a kind platform where travellers are prioritised.</p><p>Hey everyone, my name is Curtis. 26 years old living in the UK. Thanks for your interest; let me run you through the business!</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:So-what-exactly-do-we-want-to-do-different-"><span class="bold">So what exactly do we want to do different?</span></h3><ul>
<li>
<span class="bold">Social media meets booking system.</span> If you love travel, Neuraa wants to make your life easier and let you focus on travel all in one place. Chat with friends, post pictures, earn revenue, book flights &amp; hotels, manage bookings, look at reviews. It's a one-stop shop for everything travel and social.</li>
<li>Fast, direct message contact with businesses. Need to contact a hotel or airline? Request a sea view? Add a cot? Check for parking charges? Whatever it may be, in 2025 you shouldn't have to sit on hold for 2 hours, wait a week for an email reply or message them on other social media, just to find out they don't monitor their inbox. Simply go on Neuraa, DM the business and get an answer fast. <span class="bold">No more awkward phone calls or emails.</span>
</li>
<li>Customer service done correctly. No more redirecting you to decade old forums, forced FAQ pages or only Ai chat bots. Neuraa customers can add us to a chat in-app, and get a reply quickly and easily from a human. Giving users <span class="bold">easy access to support.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="bold">Customer-focused practice.</span> If you've faced issues, we want to deal with it swiftly and take it seriously. Where other booking systems don't care what hotel is listed on their site, we want to make sure our users can feel safe booking with us and take comfort in knowing we hand pick our destinations. Still, it can't always be perfect. If you do face issues, we want to prioritise<span class="bold"> you</span> and correct the situation as best as we can. We aim for customer-focused outcomes.</li>
<li>Make a social media travel career more accessible. Get paid right from your first piece of content, no need to have 1000 followers or 4000 watch hours. <span class="bold">Earn revenue from the beginning.</span>
</li>
<li>

<span class="bold">Comment thread reviews.</span> Unlike other platforms, Neuraa wants to turn business reviews into a full comment section. This gets us away from the dangerous business of fraudulent reviews that exists on almost every platform currently. With us, a person can post a review, and then the hotel, original poster, and any other users can all join in the comment section on this review. This allows everyone to join a discussion, and voice their own opinion on any issues mentioned. Maybe one person had a bad experience with food and posted a negative review, but then 6 others in the comments replied saying that they thought the food was great. This creates a real, honest view of the issue and lets potential travellers choose with more comfort. We all have different opinions and experiences; having reviews that have no ability for discussion is a dangerous path to lies, deceit, and confusion. Open comment sections will allow us to form an opinion with more confidence, making sure you know whether that hotel is the one for you or not.</li>
<li>We have an extremely long list of changes we want to bring to the industry, but there's only so much we can reveal at this stage. Keep reading for more detailed information and our visions.</li>

<p>The Neuraa app is an all-in-one travel, social, and booking dream platform. Let's start at our home page. Similar to other apps, users can see unique posts on their home page timeline. From users they follow, friends, family, and related posts the algorithm suggests for them.</p><p>Like, react, share, and join the discussion on any of these posts. Connect with other users in the comment thread, tag your friends, or see what others have to say about the destination in the post. Lots of people, all giving their honest views and discussing a hotel together. Letting users that are considering this destination to see what they are really in for. Or even to avoid it at all costs...</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:The-home-page-shorts-"><span class="bold">The home page - shorts.</span></h3><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Shorts - Home page design concept.

<p>The home page offers 1 of 2 layouts, depending on mood or even the user's current environment. Platform users can decide between the feed, where they can view long-form videos and images. Or the shorts section, where users can view short-form video content up to 3 minutes long per post. The shorts section functions in the same way; they can see posts from friends &amp; family, as well as unlimited content the algorithm thinks they will enjoy watching. Continuing the social aspect, users can like videos, comment, and share to friends inside or outside of the app. </p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Make-a-booking-"><span class="bold">Make a booking.</span></h3><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Hotel &amp; Holiday search page design concept.

Progressing with the social aspect, users will be able to invite their friends &amp; family to their bookings in-app. Where they can split the cost and let everyone have constant access to view the booking &amp; its important details. Worth mentioning, only the dedicated lead passenger will have access to make any changes.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Upload-posts-and-content-"><span class="bold">Upload posts and content.</span></h3><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Upload page design concept.

<p>Whether it's a 30-second hotel pool clip, a photo of a meal, or even a 30-minute travel vlog. You can post it all directly in the Neuraa app, grow followers &amp; views, and earn revenue from your content through a multitude of revenue streams. Including but definitely not limited to feed ads, shorts ads, affiliate commissions, Neuraa shop, and more. </p><p>We want to create a platform that welcomes everyone to generate revenue immediately. As long as a users content follows guidelines &amp; copyright policies, there are no entry requirements. Users don't need to already have thousands of followers, endless hours of accrued watch time, or even be consistently active and posting already. Anyone can post their content and get paid for their hard work from the beginning.

<p>Build a social circle. Chat with friends &amp; family, connect with other users, direct message businesses, and contact support, all in one simple inbox. Personal accounts can send each other requests to message; once these requests are approved, the chat will be in your inbox. At any time, delete, block, or mute a chat or person. As well as reporting where necessary.</p><p>Users can message business accounts directly, and business accounts can answer questions about pricing, booking changes, requests etc. Business accounts will also have a built-in spam protection to filter out sales and spam messages. Saving a hotel/airline's time to get you faster responses. Emailing is a thing of the past, and nobody enjoys making phone calls. Our app is designed to get you a clear and quick response. Not just another random, unmonitored social media business inbox. Having a booking system directly in-app is a reason for the business to be active on Neuraa; not only that, but average response times are monitored, and if a chat is not dealt with (answered, deleted, closed, etc.) in a timely manner, Neuraa will penalise the business. Ensuring our users don't need to sit waiting on hold on a phone or wait 2 weeks for a poor response by email. We are the future of hotel and airline contact. Making travel so much easier for you.</p><p>Next, our group chat feature. This allows you to add friends, family, and/or other users to a single chat. This chat will also let a booking be tagged, where everyone in the chat can see the dates, cost, and even make payments that they individually owe towards the trip. Taking away the awkwardness of asking for money when you see them. This way everyone can join the chat and make payments themselves, no questions asked. Only the lead passenger can see who has payments outstanding; this takes away most of the embarrassment for people who are a little bit behind. But it allows the lead traveller to make sure the booking stays up to date. This payment style is also just an option; if a group wants to pay up front in full or just band together and have 1 monthly payment on the booking instead, dealing with money themselves outside the app, either is perfectly acceptable.</p><p>We've been booking hotels &amp; flights for years now, with a long list of different platforms. One of the biggest drawbacks we've found in the entire travel industry currently is customer service. We aren't looking for legal troubles, so no names will be mentioned, but some of the biggest booking systems in the world incredibly have the worst customer service you could imagine. 1, 2, even 3+ hour queue times on hold for a phone call. Zero ability to contact someone by email. Unmonitored social media inboxes. In-app customer service that you don't see a response for a week and even when that response does eventually come, it's a generic copy and pasted message that doesn't answer your query. This is not just 1 company; this is most of them. Booking a hotel / holiday can be your biggest purchase of the year. You spend potentially thousands on this single purchase, and you can't even get access to speak to a human for help. Instead, useless AI chatbots that reject your request to speak to a human, or 3 hours listening to elevator music whilst you are on hold. This was one our biggest motivations for creating Neuraa. Everything surrounding a hotel or holiday should be fun; it should be exciting. Not have you stressed and panicking. </p><p>We're going to change that. Neuraa support can be contacted extremely simply, directly in your inbox inside of the Neuraa app. Start a chat with a human or with our AI assistant Neu; you can choose from the off. Neu can answer any questions, assist with changes, and help you in any way related to the booking. Or, just immediately select to speak to one of our team. We aren't going to force you through 100 pages of frequently asked questions, direct you to a useless forum, make you sit on hold for 2 hours, or have you wait 10 days for a reply by email. Simply add us to a chat, and we will reply as fast as we can. Waiting times will vary on support demand. But we aim for no longer than a 60 minute response time. Eventually, building into an immediate live chat when it is the correct stage in the business.</p><p>Excited to bring Neuraa to life is an understatement. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. I hope you can join us on this journey into changing the travel industry forever.</p><p>Thank you! - Curtis at Neuraa.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks" id="risks-and-challenges"><h2 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h2><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">The risks are pretty obvious. We are entering one of the biggest industry's on the planet, fighting against some very big competition. They've got finance, market share and the ability to buy any one out who steps on their toes.

But, change is inevitable. Google wasn't the first search engine, TikTok wasn't the first social media. It's not about who does it first, it's about who does it best. The true power lies with the users, and we're convinced we have so much to offer. As well as the viewpoint of a team of people between the ages of 26-30. We grew up on the development of technology. We are young enough to recognise what the next generation of consumers is seeking, and what they currently struggle with. This is what sets us apart from the current 50+ year old billionaires running the industry. First hand experience, struggles and realisations, all tied with the vision to fix it.</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Use of AI</h2></div><div class="border-bottom mb2"><p>We are not an Ai focused company in any format.

The idea for <span class="bold">50Plus</span> arose from my own moment of personal frustration during a walk with my dog. I found myself questioning why I was struggling to find a new job despite my experience in the field. This reflection made me realise that many others face similar challenges due to age-related biases. </p><p>Determined to make a difference, I shared my idea with my business partner in India, who immediately recognised its potential. Together, we decided to create <span class="bold">50Plus</span>—a dedicated platform empowering the 50+ generation. While we are starting with a job portal, our ultimate aim is to develop a vibrant social network where users can exchange ideas, news, and experiences and learn from each other.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Part Of Our Homepage" data-id="49006572">

<h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Problem-"><span class="bold">Problem:</span></h4><p>As people age, they often face significant challenges in re-entering the job market, primarily due to pervasive age-related biases. This struggle can lead to a decline in physical health, mental well-being and a loss of vital social connections.

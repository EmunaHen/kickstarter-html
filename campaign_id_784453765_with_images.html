Then you can invite your teammates and clients to the workspace, so that you can collaborate on projects while keeping work in sync using your own s3 storage. No more exporting backup projects that need to opened by another user who imports files from a different folder creating missing files and all those type of headaches.

<h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Quality-of-Life-design">Quality of Life design</h4><p>Software should be easy to use, yet bring you the flexibility to customize. The tours that you will be creating yourself and showing to your customers should be easy to use, as well as the software itself that you're building it with.</p><p>Everything in 360Crafter is within the details making it easy. Take for example adding a new action to a hotspot. Notice how a "1" appears next to the Actions button, as well as a "⚡️" icon on the hotspot itself on the left side panel. It's these small details that make you understand the scene instantly without checking each hotspot one by one to see where you might have added that action that's messing something up.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Adding an action shows in the Actions tabs how many actions are applied to the hotspot, as well as an action-icon on the hotspot itself." data-id="50212278">

<p>And there's many more details in this. The "👀" icon, the 6 dots drag icon to change order of both panoramas as well as hotspots. The consistent use of icons across the application. When deleting an action, hotspot, panorama, project or workspace that it first asks you if you are sure to delete it. But also the ability to ⌘ command or control click the trash icon to skip this question and just delete it instantly. Making sure command/control "Z" actually just works undoing an action. It sounds basic, but these basic things just need to work as you might expect of a modern application.</p><p>Instead of having multiple actions to Show/hide hotspot, show/hide components, open pdf popup, open image popup, it's all combined into one single action called "Edit Visibility". And in there you can choose whether you want to edit Skin visibility of Hotspot Visibility.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="50212507">

<p>Once added the action, you will see the action appear in "Applied actions". And you see the icon that represents visibility, the title that tells you it's visibility related to the Skin and a subtitle that shows you exactly what you are showing or hiding, so that you do not need to edit the action in order to see what's on there. And of course a delete icon to delete the action.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="50212617">

<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Enshittification">Enshittification</h3><p>Software can look great, have amazing features, work really well, deliver a ton of value. Start for free, built community, listen carefully to everyone and grow market share as the software gets develops. Until it dominates the market. Then it can start exploitation. Make the app worse, add in ads, spy more, move features to higher price tiers, increase pricing, let AI train on customer's software by forcing clients to click accept or else they don't have access anymore. Most of this enshittification comes from the fact that most software is proprietary closed source software. Meaning that everyone got fully dependent on it and it's made very difficult to say "No thank you" because you can't just take the latest version that you liked and use that. Everyone's supposed to either accept or delete their account.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Times-when-it-went-wrong-with-closed-source-software">Times when it went wrong with closed source software</h4><p>There's been lot of times where companies are taken over and have disappeared. Think of <span>GoPro killing Kolor</span>. What if pricing goes up and the privacy policy changes to let the company that you disagree with like <span>Adobe</span> did a year ago or more recently <span>WeTransfer</span>? Or <span>if you upload your data to a company like Matterport</span> providing them with an unrestricted, irrevocable, perpetual, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, display, publicly perform, transmit and distribute any such material you submit, without any payment or accounting to you or others? All of this is no good...</p><p>To learn more about enshittification, I'd recommend watching <span>Techlore's video</span> on it and videos from <span>Louis Rossman</span>.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:What-s-the-remedy-against-enshittification-">What's the remedy against enshittification?</h4><p>The more you dive into this subject, the more you will learn that when a company offers you the ability to fully self-host the application on your own server, you're getting in much better hands. Even if you don't know how to do it, their cloud subscription has much lower chances of getting enshittificated. Why? Because if the software gets worse, clients start moving away from their cloud and self-host the application on their own. When you're able to view the source code of the application, you're able to check what happens in there. Even if you don't know how to code, you can ask an ai to check things for you. Open source and source available might not be the full remedy against enshittification, but it's a huge step in the right direction for sure.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:How-is-360Crafter-going-to-be-licensed-">How is 360Crafter going to be licensed?</h4><p>That's exactly why 360Crafter is going to be licensed as <span class="bold">source-available </span>following the <span>fair-code principles</span> similar to how n8n does this with a <span>Sustainable Use License</span>.</p><p>You can get a full copy of all its source code and run it on your own server. You can use the source-code as it is, completely for free, make money with it creating and selling virtual tours as you are supposed to. But changing the source code and making money with it as if it is your software running it on your own server requires a different commercial license. That's the idea of a Sustainable Use License.</p><p>Having the source code available allows anyone to always downgrade or upgrade to their own liking, review the code as they want, make sure all the data is on their server to have it GDPR compliant. And all of this together makes sure there is <span class="bold">no vendor lock-in</span>. That's freedom that very few SaaS companies offer anyone nowadays. And that is exactly how 360Crafter plans to create<span class="bold"> real longterm trust</span> in the 360° virtual tour industry.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:How-is-360Crafter-created-maintained-">How is 360Crafter created &amp; maintained?</h3><p>For a very long time I thought about creating my own 360 Virtual Tour software and the cost I would have to hire a team of developers for at least a year and the huge investment I would need to pitch this idea to investors. Maybe €500.000? Having investors on board would mean I need to find investors that understand and share the same values of open-source and fair-code which is quite a large challenge already in itself. Beside that, investors generally speaking intent to motivate enshittification in order to make more money. So I discontinued the idea and moved on with other things quite some time ago in the past.</p><p>Until I started prompting in Lovable and Cursor 25th of June. I figured that a lot of these things I could prompt my way through and do it myself. So far I've spent over 100 tracked hours on 360Crafter. I've figured out how to ask the questions, solve complex bugs and use my imagination to make it in the way I think makes sense.</p><p>I'm aware there's vulnerabilities being a so-called vibe-coder. That there's things on security to double check with developers that understand code much better than I do. Allthough I ask the ai tools to be secure and not save API keys on the server whenever possible to avoid that using zero-knowledge strategies. But it does need to be checked anyway. That's going to be part of the cost creating this project, but it's going to cost much less than having a team of developers working full time on a project that hasn't sold itself yet on the market and having investors on board with different values. So I'm quite happy I need a much lower investment than I initially thought I would need.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Vision-Expectations-Priorities">Vision, Expectations &amp; Priorities</h3><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Promise-Vision">Promise &amp; Vision</h4><p>A big challenge is to provide everyone with the vision without overpromising. That's why I split features up into v1 which is my promise that will be delivered at the end of this Kickstarter campaign and v2 which are ideas I'm having, but I will very likely need more time in order to integrate those into 360Crafter. Besides that, I would love to hear everyone's opinion is about the v2 ideas and which ones are important to you. So that I can validate which ones require higher prioritization. I am super eager to have Design Tokens &amp; CMS integrated, but I'm not entirely sure if I can manage to integrate those within the 3 months period. That's why I put those in v2.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Roadmap">Roadmap</h4><p><span>Link to roadmap</span> showing features that have already been crafted, features that are coming with the first release in december this year, new features that I'm eager to work on right after that. The 360Crafter cloud/publisher so that people don't need to bring their own s3 storage and easily can publish their tours to their own custom domain is something I'd probably start working on later in v2.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Cost-of-new-features">Cost of new features</h4><p>New features of 360Crafter will be free of charge as much as I can provide those free of charge. If there's going to be integrations with ai, you can bring your own ai api keys. If I start hosting your data such as in a 360Crafter Cloud or Publisher, then that'd be something seperated from the core 360Crafter application and that'd be optional. My intent is to bring equal value in terms of new features as much as I can to both BYO s3 and 360Crafter Cloud users.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Vision-of-360Crafter-v2-">Vision of 360Crafter (v2)</h3><p>As soon as v1 is finished, 360Crafter can start working on the extra awesome features of v2 after December this year.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Design-tokens">Design tokens</h4><p>Nothing more annoying than changing the background color on 100 hotspots manually. Instead of using css classes and combo classes, 360Crafter will be using Design Tokens which brings more flexibility to design with ease. It's a modern industry web standard being used by Webstudio, Tailwind &amp; Penpot.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Static-CMS">Static CMS</h4><p>From experience building <span>skincms</span> connecting Airtable with 3DVista, I can tell that external systems to manage data can be both a blessing as well as a curse. That's why I want to start creating a CMS that's based on formats like CSV or JSON that can be exported from many applications, and then imported into the 360Crafter. The idea is that when the user exports the virtual tour, the data from these files comes static as well with this extra file in the exportfolder. Making it a single package to deliver to the client and still keeping the tour relatively easy to manage as there's no need to duplicate a popup many times.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Dynamic-CMS">Dynamic CMS</h4><p>Static CMS has it's benefits being a single package to deliver, but the downfall with it is that it's not in sync with actual data being used by whatever system the client is using. With a dynamic CMS, the client can have it's own systems to update content and it's being reflected live on the exported tours. Whether that is Airtable, Baserow, Strapi, Wordpress, Ghost, Craft, Notion or any other CMS system is up to you. Users can connect a skin popup easily to a database. Or add dynamic tooltips to hotspots, edit visibility state and many more interesting things.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Publish-tour-to-360Crafter-CDN">Publish tour to 360Crafter CDN</h4><p>A CDN stands for Content Delivery Network which generally has many servers all around the world. Let's say you are located in Amsterdam and hosting your files there. If someone from New York visits the virtual tour, it needs to travel a long distance virtually which takes more seconds to reach the server and load in the data.<br/>With a CDN there's servers all over the world and the user in New York will be automatically connected with the server closest to his location, improving loading time tremendeously.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Market-prices-after-crowdfunding">Market prices after crowdfunding</h3><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Suggestive oricing table with full prices that will probably go live after the Kickstarter campaign once 360Crafter Cloud is build." data-id="50232289">

I love to excite myself and everyone else, but need to be clear about what will be delivered. That's why I seperated features in v1 and v2.
Another risk is code vulnerabilities. As a vibe-coder I will need to have someone at my side to check the code on vulnerabilities and correct me where I'm wrong in what I've done so far. There's money allocated for that.
I will also need to double check the legal licenses to have something similar to n8n with their sustainable use license.</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Use of AI</h2></div><div class="border-bottom mb2"><h3 class="normal type-18 mt5">I plan to use AI-generated content in my project.</h3><h4 class="bold lh4" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What parts of your project will use AI generated content?

Everything else is created by me personally, such as the full story on kickstarter &amp; images. I would like to explain a bit more why I think this is creative work. I think it's mainly having the vision and experience that makes this a creative work. Knowing what things of other software in this field did wrong and being able to fundamentally offer something very new in the field because of my values of open source and fair code which are barely there in the 360° virtual tour industry. There's mainly proprietary software available in this field.
I've already created a few videos on my Youtube channel about progress made (@360Creators) since 7th of July. I can share my tracked work hours (100+) with Kickstarter if needed.</p><h4 class="bold lh4" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Do you have the consent of owners of the works that were (or will be) used to produce the AI generated portion of your projects?

On Lovable pricing page FAQ (<span>https://lovable.dev/pricing</span>) it is said that:
Who owns the projects and code?
You do. You can collaborate at source or check out your changes using GitHub. Learn more.

On Cursor pricing page (<span>https://cursor.com/pricing</span>) FAQ:
Who owns the code generated in Cursor?
You! Regardless of whether you use the free, pro or business version of Cursor, all generated code is yours and free to be used however you like, including commercially.</p></div><div class="mt5"><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about AI policy on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-commitments" id="environmentalCommitments"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Environmental commitments</h2><span><span class="ksr-green-700">Visit our Environmental Resources Center</span> to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.</span></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Long-lasting design</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">The project will be publicly available on a Github or Gitlab page with version control. Each version is saved there publicly. If for whatever reason I would quit on 360Crafter and stop managing the cloudversion of my product, there's options to selfhost the application.
Beside that even people using the cloudversion, can connect their own s3 storage so that 360Crafter doesn't save projectdata and exportdata into their own cloud. If the 360Crafter application server would go down, people still have access to their own data who use their own s3 storage and can reconnect it with hosting the application on their own server with the publicly available source code if needed.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Reusability and recyclability</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">I know this question is more for creatives that use kickstarter to create a fysical product, but I still want to answer this question as a software developer. My "materials and packaging" are mainly the code dependencies which are open source and permissive licenses like Three.js being one of them. My intent is to have a percentage of my income donated to the maintainers of these dependencies, so that they can keep working on it and pay their bills.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Sustainable Distribution</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">I'm planning to host the 360Crafter application using a Hetzner server which have written this on sustainability:
https://www.hetzner.com/unternehmen/nachhaltigkeit/</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Something else</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">I've given it a lot of thought whether I should go for an open-source license myself, whether that should be permissive or copyleft. And whether that is sustainable. There's a lot of debate whether giving away everything completely for free and letting anyone copy your code and reselling that is fair or not. Fair-Code is not open-source according to OSI (https://opensource.org/), but I think it does solve the commercial aspect to have commercial limitations on using the source code while following a lot of open-source values such as providing privacy with the ability to host it where people want to, insights in the code and removing artificial limitations in order to sell something. Combining the technicalities with the legal aspects to have a middle ground for financial success while still being very open about the whole thing.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span>Questions about this project? </span><span class="bold link-blue type-16">Check out the FAQ</span></div></div><div id="report-this-project"><span class="kds-button kds-button">Report this project to Kickstarter</span></div></div>

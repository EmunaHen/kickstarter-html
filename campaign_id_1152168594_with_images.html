<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:SwivX-An-Idea-is-Born"><span class="bold">SwivX: An Idea is Born</span></h3><p>The journey of SwivX really began with my background as a chiropractor of nearly 28 years. I didn’t follow the traditional chiropractic path and instead worked with an orthopedic surgeon and a sports chiropractor who introduced me to physical rehabilitation and injury prevention. This ultimately led to an interview with the San Francisco 49ers and the opportunity to become one of their team chiropractors for 8 years. In this role, I found it interesting that these professional athletes were suffering from the same types of injuries as the general public…<span class="bold">but why?</span></p><p>Sure, there were intense injuries with players, like we have all seen on TV, but more commonly I would see disc injuries in the same region as the patients I saw on a daily basis.  Many of these injuries were not due to impact during the game but were caused by poor posture while traveling on planes and buses.  <img class="image" data-id="49654776" src="https://i.kickstarter.com/assets/049/654/776/a0a672426ba9ca0fbb8d1dbc4a24fad7_original.png?fit=scale-down&amp;origin=ugc&amp;q=92&amp;v=1749754253&amp;width=4400&amp;sig=tE1NVrV3u4FOxT0wqeOKpa68mSiFa%2FZXBWuMjJ5HFJA%3D"/></p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Just-like-my-patients-these-athletes-had-no-idea-that-slumping-in-a-chair-while-gaming-or-texting-on-smartphones-could-be-the-cause-of-their-problem-"><span class="bold">Just like my patients, these athletes had no idea that slumping in a chair while gaming or texting on smartphones could be the cause of their problem.</span></h4><p>Throughout my career I have been able to experience amazing results for patients by implementing proper posture and body mechanic techniques. Unfortunately, I never had a tool like SwivX. I would constantly remind my patients to lift their phones up so that they would stop slumping. We would all talk about the new term ”Tech Neck” and kind of snicker, but now those words are constantly in the news because we are all using technology everyday and suffering from the consequences. </p><p>Prior to 2015 I would rarely see a child enter my clinic due to technology related issues and now it seems to be a daily occurrence. A few years ago I was treating one of my patients and her child accompanied her. The young boy was slumped over his phone while gaming so I gently reached over and moved his phone to a higher position. </p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:That-was-the-match-that-lit-the-fire-I-couldn-t-stop-thinking-about-it-and-quite-frankly-became-obsessed-with-solving-this-problem-"><span class="bold">That was the match that lit the fire!  I couldn’t stop thinking about it and quite frankly became obsessed with solving this problem. </span></h4><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49656668">

<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Developing-the-Product-A-Sneak-Peek"><span class="bold">Developing the Product: A Sneak Peek</span></h3><p>I came up with some initial designs for a phone-based prototype to test my idea and found that I could indeed make it work.  Over the past few years every detail was looked at from battery optimization to the way the metal ring helps the ergonomic holding position. Working with mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, software programmers, artists, and videographers was all part of the journey. It definitely takes a village to develop a product. I was eventually awarded a utility patent and received FCC approval and the SwivX device was finally taking shape.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49655232">

<p>Spending the past few years developing the product and creating hundreds of prototypes has been a labor of love. In the beginning of this journey, I used a 3D printer in my garage to help me design hundreds of prototypes just to get everything perfect. My first attempt was not that elegant and involved putting some components into a plastic container that looked like a thick, strangely-shaped heart. Eventually the internal components were streamlined and the design became much more sleek and functional. I now have all the injection molds made and ready to go with my supply chain manufacturers eager to support this Kickstarter campaign.</p>
<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Real-World-Testing"><span class="bold">Real-World Testing</span></h3><p>Although SwivX has not been made public, the testing results achieved so far have been so rewarding. I have had the opportunity for patients, friends, and family to use the device and App in beta testing. </p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:-They-were-all-in-awe-when-they-saw-how-fast-it-worked-">

As with any tech-based project, there are a few risks that we may encounter.  We have worked to mitigate risks by receiving a utility patent and FCC approval for our product.  In addition, we have spent the past few years building prototypes, doing user testing, and refining our design. Once our campaign reaches its successful funding, we will start manufacturing immediately so we can send your rewards to you as quickly as possible. Although we have carefully mapped out our supply chain process and timeline, unexpected fulfillment issues may arise. Unknown geopolitical-tariffs may cause disruption to our pricing model or supply chain. In the event of any unexpected issues, we promise to provide regular updates to our backers.

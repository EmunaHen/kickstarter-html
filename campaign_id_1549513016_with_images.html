Each journal entry will then be paired with valuable insights that are displayed in a simple, digestible way, allowing you to truly understand your thoughts.</p><p>We’ve specifically created <span class="bold">scripted.</span> for those that are new to journaling or have been unsuccessful in integrating journaling into their routine. With <span class="bold">scripted.</span> all you need is your voice. We’ll do the rest including daily reminders to journal, prompting you to keep up that streak 🔥</p><p>Simply start a journal entry and begin speaking for the app to begin transcribing your voice into text. Once you've finished simply end your recording and <span class="bold">scripted.</span> will quickly convert your speech to text. Once complete, our technology will begin to analyse your entry for mood, sentiment, and tone, giving you deep analysis of your entry. A summary will also be generated to accompany each analysis. Furthermore, your original recording and transcript will be available at any time. </p><p>As you journal, monthly highlights will also give you valuable insights at a macro level. Bespoke goals will also be created for you to take into the next month, tailored to meet your needs. </p><p><span class="bold">scripted.</span> is your new tool to unleash your potential, work through emotional struggles, record thoughts in the moment as they happen, as well as much more… </p><p>To summarise, your <span class="bold">scripted.</span> subscription will enable you to:</p><ul>

</h3><p>Hi there! My name is Zack, I’m 26, and I founded <span class="bold">scripted. </span>to create the ultimate journaling tool, powered by your voice. </p><p>The idea for <span class="bold">scripted.</span> was curated using my personal struggles with mental health. Where my inability to address trauma and speak about emotions negativity affected my life experience in my early twenties. </p><p>When I found journaling, I discovered a new best friend. Someone who I could reveal all my inner thoughts to without feeling judged. No matter how unrefined they were, pure elation or sorrow, dreams for a better future, regrets I pushed down for years. </p><p>Experimenting with voice notes and summarising entries to return to later, led me to develop the <span class="bold">scripted.</span> concept into what it is today. <span class="bold">scripted.</span> is in my opinion the purest form of journaling, using the voice to generate entries and insights automatically. I found speaking my thoughts even more freeing than hand writing notes, and gained confidence which I took forward when speaking in public at work. </p><p>This is something that I want to share with you as a refined product, and I truly believe that <span class="bold">scripted.</span> can be used as a powerful tool for all those that are willing to give it a try!</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:-Journal-Automatically-As-You-Talk-">🏎️ <span class="bold">Journal Automatically As You Talk</span>
</h4><p><span class="bold">Journal faster using only your voice and your journal will automatically convert your entry to text in a matter of seconds.</span> Remove the excuse of not having time to journal, and get insights delivered straight to your app.</p><p>As soon as your finish your journaling entry our powerful technology will get to work:</p><ul>
<li>Converting your speech into text.</li>
<li>Summarising your transcript making it easier to digest when you come back to it.</li>
<li>Analysing your entry for mood, tone, and sentiment. </li>

This means we have a functioning prototype. In order to develop this into a fully polished iOS app we need your support. Our greatest risk is therefore that we do not successfully fund our campaign. I am confident with this great community that we will be successful in this. Therefore, following this, the associated challenges are also present:

  DEVELOPMENT: We will be working with a professional developer for iOS devices that has experience working with all the technologies that we are interested in using for the scripted. app. We have an initial lead time estimate from the developer of 21 days. However, we cannot fully engage the developer and get an official lead time until we have the funds for this work. Therefore, there may be some tolerance associated with this time scale.

  GO LIVE: Once development is complete we will need to fully test the application before we are prepared to launch it to customers. We expect the developer to test fully, however if user testing reveals any bugs we will need to go back to the developer to fix these issues. We are therefore, giving a month period from development completion for user testing to occur before we go live. 

I promise to keep all backers updated with the progress of the application and will be sharing details and sneak peaks as we progress. scripted. is the a passion project for me and I truly believe in the power that this new way of journaling can give all those who are prepared to give it a try. I greatly appreciate your trust and support with this project. Together we’ll bring this concept to life and I’m looking forward to sharing it with you all in due course!</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-commitments" id="environmentalCommitments"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Environmental commitments</h2><span><span class="ksr-green-700">Visit our Environmental Resources Center</span> to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.</span></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Long-lasting design</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">Your scripted. journal will always be available in the cloud, as will travel with you from device to device.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Something else</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">Through turning journaling digital we reduce the amount of paper being used for journaling purposes.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span>Questions about this project? </span><span class="bold link-blue type-16">Check out the FAQ</span></div></div><div id="report-this-project"><span class="kds-button kds-button">Report this project to Kickstarter</span></div></div>

They offer a fun, eco-friendly, and efficient way to commute or explore cities. However, despite the advances in speed, battery life, and design, many electric skateboards on the market today still lack essential safety features and user-friendly technology integration. That’s where the idea for <span class="bold">Sentinel Board</span> was born, a smart, safer, and more intuitive electric skateboard designed for everyone.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49572379">

<h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:The-Problem-We-Wanted-to-Solve">The Problem We Wanted to Solve</h4><p>As avid skateboarders and tech enthusiasts, our team experienced firsthand the frustrations and risks associated with existing electric skateboards. Many models did not adequately address user safety in real-world scenarios such as sudden falls, collisions, or unauthorized use. Traditional boards could keep moving after a rider fell off, causing dangerous situations for the rider and pedestrians. Moreover, most boards lacked adaptive technology to improve rider awareness or provide feedback through apps, which could enhance the overall riding experience.</p><p>We also noticed that the market offered limited options for riders needing longer range, while others had to compromise between portability and battery life. Additionally, user interfaces were often clunky, with remote controls that could easily be lost or broken, adding to the inconvenience.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Our-Vision-Intelligent-Safety-and-Simplicity">Our Vision: Intelligent Safety and Simplicity</h4><p>We envisioned a skateboard that could sense the rider’s presence and react accordingly a board that would stop safely if the rider falls off or if it detects an obstacle nearby. We wanted to remove bulky, fragile remote controls by integrating smart sensors and an intuitive mobile app. The <span class="bold">Sentinel Board</span> project was born with one goal: <span class="bold">to deliver an electric skateboard that is not only fun and efficient but also intelligent, safe, and easy to use</span>.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:How-Sentinel-Board-Stands-Out">How Sentinel Board Stands Out</h3><p>Our design philosophy focuses on three core innovations:</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:1-Weight-Detection-Sensor">1. Weight Detection Sensor</h4><p>At the heart of Sentinel Board lies an advanced weight sensor. This sensor continuously monitors whether a rider is on the board. If the rider falls off, the board automatically stops within milliseconds, preventing accidents or runaway skateboards. This system ensures that the board is only active when someone is riding it, increasing safety for everyone.</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:2-Obstacle-Detection-Technology">2. Obstacle Detection Technology</h4><p>Using proximity sensors embedded in the deck, Sentinel Board can detect obstacles in its path. When an obstacle is detected too close, the board alerts the rider via the mobile app and adaptive LEDs on the deck, allowing the rider to react promptly and avoid collisions. This feature adds a new layer of safety, especially in crowded or unpredictable urban environments.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49572382">

<h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:3-Two-Model-Options-Standard-and-Extended-Range">3. Two Model Options: Standard and Extended Range</h4><p>Understanding that riders have different needs, we created two versions of Sentinel Board. The Standard model offers a balanced range of 20-30 km per charge, perfect for everyday urban commutes. The Extended Range model caters to riders requiring longer distances, offering up to 50 km on a single charge without compromising portability. Both models maintain the same safety features and smart integration.</p><p>Removing the Remote, Embracing Smart Connectivity</p><p>Instead of a traditional remote control which can be lost, damaged, or awkward Sentinel Board uses a dedicated mobile app connected via Bluetooth. The app offers:</p><p>Real-time speed and battery monitoring</p><p>Lock/unlock feature to prevent unauthorized use</p><p>Ride statistics and logs</p><p>Alerts for obstacles and safety notifications</p><p>Customizable LED colors and light patterns</p><p>This approach reduces hardware clutter and puts control in the rider’s pocket, accessible anytime.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Prototype components shown - not final design.

<p>Sentinel Board isn’t just another electric skateboard. It’s a smart, safety-focused mobility platform designed from the ground up using a modular engineering approach. From the very first sketch to our current working prototype, every component has been carefully selected to deliver an intuitive and secure riding experience.</p><p>At the heart of Sentinel is a dual-hub motor drive system quiet, efficient, and built for urban environments. It’s powered by a lithium-ion battery pack featuring smart thermal regulation for consistent performance and long-term durability. The Standard version offers a 20–30 km range, while the Extended Range model comes with a larger, swappable battery module that pushes the range up to 50 km.</p><p>The board’s intelligence is managed by a custom-designed PCB powered by an STM32 microcontroller. This unit processes real-time input from a network of sensors, including weight/load sensors embedded in the deck. These detect rider presence and can immediately stop the board if the rider dismounts or falls a major leap forward in electric skateboard safety.</p><p>In the nose of the board, we’ve embedded an obstacle detection array using ultrasonic and infrared proximity sensors. These continuously scan the rider’s path and feed data to the Sentinel mobile app, offering real-time alerts and adaptive speed control in future software updates.</p><p>The current prototype deck is made from CNC-cut bamboo and fiberglass layers for ideal shock absorption and flexibility. The trucks are equipped with modular hub wheels and swappable PU sleeves for ease of maintenance. Electronics are housed in a 3D-printed casing, which will transition to molded ABS in the final product for enhanced durability and weather resistance.</p><p>Connectivity is powered by Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE 5.0), allowing smooth interaction with the companion mobile app. The app provides insights like ride analytics, battery health, firmware updates, and even LED customization to personalize your board.</p><p>Every part of the Sentinel Board has been designed not only to function, but to evolve. As we test, iterate, and refine, our focus remains clear: delivering a product that feels like the future and earns your trust.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Roadmap">Roadmap</h3><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Q3-2025-Prototype-Finalization">Q3 2025 - Prototype Finalization</h4><p>Complete hardware design refinements</p><p>Finalize sensor integration (weight detection &amp; obstacle avoidance)</p><p>Develop stable firmware and mobile app basics</p><p>Conduct extensive safety and reliability tests</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Q4-2025-Pre-Production-Beta-Testing">Q4 2025 - Pre-Production &amp; Beta Testing</h4><p>Produce small batch of beta units</p><p>Distribute beta boards to early testers</p><p>Collect feedback and implement improvements</p><p>Develop full-featured mobile app (iOS &amp; Android)</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Q1-2026-Production-Setup">Q1 2026 - Production Setup</h4><p>Order components and materials at scale</p><p>Begin packaging design and testing</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Q2-2026-Manufacturing-Quality-Assurance">Q2 2026 - Manufacturing &amp; Quality Assurance</h4><p>Start  production of Standard and Extended Range models</p><p>Perform rigorous quality assurance testing on production units</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Q3-2026-Shipping-Launch">Q3 2026 - Shipping &amp; Launch</h4><p>Ship Kickstarter rewards to backers worldwide</p><p>Official launch of Sentinel Board to the general public</p><p>Release final mobile app with full features and ongoing support</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Beyond-2026-Continuous-Improvement-Expansion">Beyond 2026 - Continuous Improvement &amp; Expansion</h4><p>Launch software updates based on user feedback</p><p>Explore additional accessories and upgrades</p><p>Expand product line with new models or features</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49591177">

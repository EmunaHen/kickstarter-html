<div class="mb-4 last:mb-0 whitespace-pre-wrap u-break-words text-[16px] color-[var(--theme-text-primary)] leading-[28px]">Hi, I'm Francis San Diego, founder and CEO of CourtIQ. Like many of you, I've spent countless hours on basketball courts - playing, coaching, and watching the sport I love. But I've also witnessed a frustrating reality: the massive gap between professional basketball analytics and what's available to everyone else</div>
<div class="mb-4 last:mb-0 whitespace-pre-wrap u-break-words text-[16px] color-[var(--theme-text-primary)] leading-[28px]">.</div>
</div>
<div class="mb-[16px]">
<div class="mb-4 last:mb-0 whitespace-pre-wrap u-break-words text-[16px] color-[var(--theme-text-primary)] leading-[28px]">I've watched talented coaches struggle with clipboards and stopwatches, trying to track statistics manually while missing the action on the court. I've seen gifted players go unnoticed because they didn't have access to the data that could showcase their abilities. I've experienced the challenge of finding good pickup games and connecting with other basketball enthusiasts in my community.</div>
</div>
<div class="mb-[16px]">
<div class="mb-4 last:mb-0 whitespace-pre-wrap u-break-words text-[16px] color-[var(--theme-text-primary)] leading-[28px]">That's when I realized: basketball needed a technology revolution.</div>
<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:The-Problem-is-Real"><span class="bold">The Problem is Real</span></h3>
<p>The statistics are staggering. There are over 400,000 youth basketball teams in the United States alone, plus 12 million adult recreational players. Yet 95% of these teams have no access to the analytics tools that professional teams consider essential.</p>
<p>Existing solutions like Hudl, SportsCode, and Synergy cost $10,000-50,000 annually, making them accessible only to elite high school programs, colleges, and professional teams. This creates a massive inequality in basketball development - the rich get richer while everyone else is left behind.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, coaches at every level spend hours manually tracking statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing down shot attempts and makes </li>
<li>Timing player rotations with stopwatches</li>

<p>I knew there had to be a better way. What if we could use artificial intelligence and computer vision to automatically analyze basketball games? What if we could make professional-grade analytics accessible to every team, regardless of budget? What if we could build a platform that not only provided analytics but also connected basketball communities?</p>
<p>That vision became CourtIQ.</p>

There are over 400,000 youth basketball teams in the United States alone, plus 12 million adult recreational players. Yet 95% of these teams have no access to the analytics tools that professional teams consider essential.

Existing solutions like Hudl, SportsCode, and Synergy cost $10,000-50,000 annually, making them accessible only to elite high school programs, colleges, and professional teams. This creates a massive inequality in basketball development - the rich get richer while everyone else is left behind.

Meanwhile, coaches at every level spend hours manually tracking statistics:
• Writing down shot attempts and makes
• Timing player rotations with stopwatches


• Trying to remember key plays for post-game analysis
• Missing crucial insights because they can't watch and record simultaneously

Players suffer too:
• No objective way to track improvement over time
• Limited feedback on performance and areas for development
• Difficulty finding games and connecting with other players
• No access to the insights that could accelerate their growth</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Use of AI</h2></div><div class="border-bottom mb2"><p>CourtIQ incorporates AI technology as a core component of our basketball analytics platform.

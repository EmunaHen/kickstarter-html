<p>The MiniDisc audio format started in 1992 and production of the devices slowed to an end around 2008 with some odd units being produced until 2020 or so. With millions of discs produced since 1992, it was just announced that Sony (the last producers of the minidisc) will stop manufacturing them this year in 2025. New discs have only been purchasable in Japan as of late which has made acquiring new inventory difficult. </p><p>Since 2020, there's been a steady rise of people around the world adapting the use of the minidisc format - myself included! Some of these people were users in 1990's, while some are first time users and enthusiasts. </p><p>The current trend of audio media has been primarily leaning towards streaming for the last several years, and prior to that, the use of iPods and MP3 players. But there's something interesting and special with a physical format. Over the last decade we've all seen the resurgence of vinyl records and cassette tapes, and if you've ever used one, not only do they sound different, but it's the tactile experience that really sets things apart from digital media. </p><p>When I started using minidiscs again, one thing that caught my attention was the use of the disc. The experience of handling the disc; inserting, ejecting, shuffling through them... it was like handling a future we had always dreamed of. I began to think... what could enhance this experience? What could improve the tactile feeling of using minidiscs? </p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:The-Passion-Project">The Passion Project</h4><p>One thing that made minidiscs special was that there were a lot of brands making and designing discs with different aesthetics. What I had noticed was that there was only one disc ever manufactured that was made from an alloy - the Sony MD2000. It was made from two pieces of stamped magnesium - a popular alloy at the time that Sony used for many of their portable devices. The disc is beautiful and is quite a collectors item now. </p><p>I wanted to take it one step further. </p><p>In 2023 I started to reverse engineer the minidisc, taking design influences from various styles but leaned towards the two discs that were held together by screws: the TDK MD-XG and the TDK Pro. </p><p>Since I didn't want to injection mold another plastic disc, I made modifications to the design based on the TDK Pro to allow for a disc that could be machined from billet aluminum. From a material standpoint, aluminum stood out. It is easier to machine than steel, it does not rust, and can be anodized for color, rather than being painted which would add thickness. </p><p>Additionally, aluminum would add a nice weighty feel when you hold it, and would be cool to the touch. At this point, you would know you're holding something special.</p><p>Beyond being a unique disc to own and the enjoyable tactile aspects, this does become a solution for those who have had discs degrade over the years. Some discs, especially the older ones, have experienced cracking and splitting. And while the optical disc may still work, it isn't recommend to insert a disc with a broken plastic shell as the risk that something may jam the internal components of the device the disc is in. Now, you can place the optical disc inside this aluminum shell. </p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Prototyping">Prototyping</h4><p>I made my first prototype at the end of 2023 just to see if it could be possible... and it absolutely was.

<p>I kept all the original design elements from the TDK Pro and borrowed the plastic components from the original disc as well as the shutter. </p><p>I decided I had to make some changes so that the machining process would be simplified to keep manufacturing costs down.

<p>While I knew polishing the disc wouldn't be a viable option for mass production, I felt like it would be great to use for a subsequent project if this aluminum minidisc gets funded. </p><p>The changes were great, and while testing, I went on to explore other finishing possibilities. I made two more to see if other manufacturers could handle the machining as well as try brushing the surface. </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Prototype #3 with a black Maxell OZ disc inserted" data-id="48338647">

<figcaption class="px2">Prototype #3 and #4 explored some minor CNC changes and brushed finishing</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I absolutely love the look of the brushing but it was inconsistent and created a lot of issues with warping from the pressure of brushing. It was definitely frustrating but I knew I had to axe this option (for now). </p><p>Moving forward, I knew I needed to focus on the manufacturing element and I decided on some key decisions:</p><ul>
<li>CNC Machining the minidisc will require 5-axis machining to ensure tolerance would be held without fear of warping. </li>
<li>Sandblasting finish will be the only way to ensure repeatability</li>
<li>I will need to make my own tooling for the plastic pieces and the shutter</li>
</ul><p>The last point was critical... and costly. Originally, I thought it would be viable for the users to use an old disc and salvage the plastic bits and the shutter and all would be good. However, it turns out that there are so many types of discs and ensuring that what the new owner would have at their disposal would work 100% would be difficult. I wanted to offer a turn-key solution that would work. So, in order to do so, I opted to create tooling for the plastic shutter lock, the plastic write protect slider, and the metal shutter. </p><p>I had also made some minor changes to the CAD files which meant making yet another prototype disc - this time in gold. </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Assembly of Prototype #5 with the new plastic pieces and new stamped stainless shutter" data-id="48338749">

<p>The QC process and analysis went well - everyone was quite happy with the progress. And yes, that last photo above is me (selfie) along with the factory owners. </p><p>These new parts worked out great except for one problem. Me. </p><p>I got picky. </p><p>The shutter shown here was made in stainless steel because there was a manufacturing fear about sourcing aluminum, and bending aluminum that was so thin. But stainless steel (304SS here) could not be coated the same color as the disc. It would always remain silver. </p><p>I explored other options and while painting is out of the question due to the added thickness (I am working with very tight tolerances here - 0.01mm), PVD was shown to be an option. But after further investigation, the processes involved in PVD coating would create another snowball effect of problems. It ultimately wouldn't be the best route to take. </p><p>My decision came down to finding a custom sheet manufacturer for aluminum. This allowed me to have the entire disc anodized in the same color, and provide opportunity for laser etching in the future. </p><p>Additionally, I made some final changes by adding micro details: </p><ul>
<li>Added radii to the small holes for a smoother edge. This would prevent snagging on moving parts in the player. </li>
<li>Added a cutout where the write protect tab is so it would be easier for fingers to move the tab back and forth. </li>
</ul><p>And what did this all mean? Another prototype:</p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:The-Final-Prototype">The Final Prototype</h4><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Blue and bold - arrived January 20th in Toronto, Canada" data-id="48338843">

<p>This blue prototype was received early this year just at the end of January. The tests have been fantastic and I'm very happy with it. So what was the next step? Figuring out the plan for production. </p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:The-Funding-Reward-Making-this-a-Reality">The Funding &amp; Reward - Making this a Reality</h4><p>I had already invested a lot into taking the project this far. Unfortunately I don't have the funds to mass produce them, and I do understand that the demographic interested would be rather niche. However, all I want is to see this through; making this a reality would be fantastic. But I'll need your help. </p><p>So here are the details: </p><ul>
<li>100 units will be offered in a total of 5 different colors</li>
<li>The colors (based on a poll taken on Minidisc Central) will be: Black, Blue, Red, Green, and Purple.</li>
<li>There will be 20 pieces of each color offered</li>
<li>Each disc will bear a serial number </li>
<li>Each disc reward will be supplied with hardware to assemble, extra shutter in the matching color, and extra plastic pieces </li>
<li>The plastic pieces, shutter lock and write protect tab, will all be the same color regardless of the disc color. </li>
<li>If more discs are to be produced in the future (with your help funding this one, future ones would be more viable!), I will not be reissuing the same colors. These specific shades will be unique to this production run. </li>
<li>The price is $200CAD ($170 for the disc and $30 for global shipping) which works out to $123USD (plus $21.65USD shipping) at current exchange rates. </li>
<li>Each disc reward will include a clear jewel case from minidisc.me; the best full size minidisc jewel case!</li>

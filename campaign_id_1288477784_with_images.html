With one touch.</span></p><p>In a world where the computer has become an indispensable tool both for professional and home use, we have noticed that many operations are now repetitive, many texts, many operations and above all access to portals or Emails are daily and recurring, how many times a day to access our services do we have to type our login and password? This device allows you to quickly accelerate these operations with the simple press of an icon, if we consider the use of the device for our work we can imagine at the end of the day a saving of time and no more problems of having forgotten an access password.</p><p><span class="bold">Your security, your time, zero passwords saved on your PC, one touch. All done.</span></p><p>As regards the security of our personal data we all know how inadvisable it is to save our passwords when we use a Browser, there is a real risk of Trojan programs that can extrapolate our access credentials without great difficulty, or to use easily memorable passwords, such as dates of birth, names of children, etc., not to mention the fact that probably for security reasons in the future it will no longer be possible to choose to store passwords automatically.</p><p><span class="bold">Protect your credentials with the strength of a password as long as the universe itself.</span></p><p>Having said that, do you know how long a hacker with modest knowledge and a normal PC with a latest generation video card can take to find an 8-character password? About 3 hours, the Columbus Egg device can manage any type of password thanks to its internal generator of 12, 16 or 32 characters including special ones, with a password of this complexity to be able to find it even with the most powerful computers we are talking about times of billions of years, probably more than the life of the universe, on the other hand these complex passwords are difficult to manage and enter, but with the use of our Columbus Egg device these entries are possible with the simple press of an icon, furthermore the strong point these passwords do not reside or stored inside our computer, therefore they cannot be extrapolated by any type of malicious software.</p><p><span class="bold">From repetitive to immediate, automate your day, one click a command, every touch a benefit.</span></p><p>As you can see, the device looks like a small Tablet with a 3.5” IPS color LCD screen, the small device includes a capacitive touch screen for interaction with its user, the connection to the computer is via a normal USB cable, the device is powered by the computer and therefore does not require batteries or charging operations.</p><p>The Columbus Egg, this is its name, is actually a keyboard emulator, it allows you to automatically insert recurring texts, emails or login texts, passwords, commands associated with the CTRL+ key, the launch of applications by simply pressing an icon and the device includes a password generator to facilitate the management and security of access.</p><p>Each of the 48 available keys can be customized and programmed to perform one of the available functions, the Columbus Egg can manage up to 4 independent users, the data of each user is visible only by the same user, all data and passwords are protected by PIN and encrypted with a unique 128-bit key.</p><p>Currently the device is compatible with the operating systems, Windows, MacOS, Linux-Ubuntu and can support up to 7 languages, American (US), Italian (IT) Spanish (ES), Portuguese (PT), French (FR), German (DE), English (UK).</p><p>The device in addition to the use described, allows the Backup of data for each individual user, the restoration or migration of data always for each individual user, the possibility of updates and scalability.</p><p>The device has functions for energy saving and reduction of display brightness.</p><p><span class="bold">Columbus' egg, how is it connected?</span></p>
<p>As you can see in this video, the Columbus Egg will load its operating system once connected, on the screen we can see the logo and the name of the manufacturer at the top, at the bottom right we have a QR Code that when framed can take us to the manufacturer's website where it will be possible to download the documentation such as DataSheet and Manuals and other technical information, furthermore at the bottom right we can see the version of the software currently installed.</p><p>For orders in quantity it is possible to customize this page by inserting the logo and name of the customer's company, taking advantage of this possibility the Columbus Egg also thanks to a low cost could be a beautiful Gadget to give to your customers for advertising, or a corporate gift for your collaborators or an accessory to match your hardware, as you can imagine the possibilities of use are endless, our company will be happy to accompany you towards any customizations.</p><p><span class="bold">Columbus' Egg, how do you access it?</span></p>
<p>As you can see from the video after a few seconds you arrive at the Login page, here one of the four available users can log in, entering their PIN, which by default is 1234 but obviously can be changed, the PIN entry is masked by asterisks for security reasons, but it is possible to make it visible by pressing the green button, in case of an entry error it is possible to cancel the entry with the red button and repeat the operation.</p><p>At the top left there is the icon to activate or deactivate WiFi, activation allows the device to be reachable from any device with WiFi and from the Browser to carry out the configuration and programming of the keys.</p><p>In normal operation it is always recommended to keep WiFi turned off, in this way the device being disconnected from any network cannot be reachable by any attack attempt.</p><p><span class="bold">Columbus' Egg, how is it used?</span></p>
<p>In this video we can see the normal operation of the Columbus Egg, we have made some of the most common examples, we think that the device once customized for your needs can be used in an infinite number of applications, from office use, industrial, development but it can also be very useful for home use, for access management and many other occasions.</p><p>In the video you can see how it is used to easily access Windows,</p><p>how to quickly access an Email,</p><p>how to write the text of a frequently used Email and how to choose it from those stored,</p><p>use the keys already programmed with the functions select, copy, delete, paste, save, print, etc.,</p><p>the use of special characters in the mathematical, commercial and other chapters,</p><p>the use of the built-in password generator,</p><p>the simplified start of applications,</p><p>the use of the device for entering prices,</p><p>these are just examples, all the other possible things depend on the user and his imagination.</p><p><span class="bold">Columbus' Egg, Password Generator?</span></p>
<p>In this video you can see how to use the password generator, very often when we register on sites or portals that ask us to enter a password and ask us that this is of a certain complexity, also for security it is strongly discouraged to use passwords used for other registrations, these must always be original and unique, for this reason our device makes this operation extremely easy, as you can see from the video, at the time of the request it is sufficient to press for a few seconds the icon in which we want to store our password, then we can choose the degree of difficulty, we generate the most complex one and insert a "return" at the end to confirm the insertion when it is emulated, once saved the icon will become white and renamed "Random Password", these settings can subsequently be changed at will and renamed as we like.</p><p>Columbus' egg, how do you set the icons?</p>
<p>In this video we enter the live part of programming, the configuration or variation of a new user, this is an initialization phase in which it is necessary to specify with which operating system the device is used and the keyboard layout to choose from the 7 available languages, this phase is very important, do not perform this first phase or a configuration error could cause errors in the emulation of the stored texts.</p><p>In this last video we can see the configuration or variation of each single key of the 48 available, first of all it is recommended to select the function of the key, if text, password, CRTL+ command, RUN+ command, in case of password generate the string or insert the text or command that we need to use, select the color and insert the name of the key in the two input boxes, check if we want to apply a Return (cr) to our command at the end and save the configuration.</p><p>Our key is configured and ready to be used, obviously its configuration can be modified at any time.</p><p><span class="bold">Attention: To perform the configuration you need a computer, tablet or smartphone with WiFi.</span></p><p>How the Columbus Egg was born.</p><p>After thinking that having a tool like the Columbus Egg could be a winning idea, we began the first feasibility studies, researching the main components, and then the first rudimentary prototype.</p><p><span class="bold">Here is the first Columbus Egg, it all started here, photo from below:</span></p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="50169228">

<p>Even though version 1.0 didn't give us any problems after a series of tests and updates, we decided to make some changes, the main ones being the replacement of the buttons with larger, more robust models and the addition of an audio buffer to increase the volume and its robustness.</p><p><span class="bold">Foto CAD Ver: 1.1:</span></p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="50169281">

<p>After the electronics were designed by our mechanical engineer, the first prototype enclosure was created. We attempted to create a small box that could fit inside a small container and feature a rear bracket for tilted use, as you can see in the photos. Robustness was not overlooked; its wraparound shape was designed to cushion and protect the screen as much as possible from any impacts or falls.</p><p>As you can see, both the hardware and software were developed entirely in-house by our programmers and engineers, using the latest technologies available today and materials with excellent value for money.</p><p>Since we own all intellectual property rights to the device, we can, if necessary, evaluate any requests for modifications or customizations from interested companies.</p><p>For any further information, please contact us.</p><p><span class="bold">CAD photo:</span></p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="50169302">

<p>Finally, the electronics component has now reached its final stage and its industrialization is complete. The mechanical component is in an advanced stage of design, with the first 3D-printed prototypes tested and ready for use. The next step is the creation of a steel mold for industrial production of the box, reducing costs with large-scale production. We are confident that this fundraising campaign will be completed to finance this final phase, which is necessary to reduce production costs.</p><p><span class="bold">A Live Use of the Columbus Egg</span></p>

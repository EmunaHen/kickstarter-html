<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Background-Introducing-the-Hang-n-Go-Range"><span class="bold">Background - Introducing the Hang 'n Go Range</span></h3><p>Hi, my name is Rob McAlister. Over the last few years, I’ve been working on a solution to a simple but persistent everyday problem. How can you dry your washing outdoors even when it rains? </p><p>I've developed three new outdoor laundry products, which I call the "<span class="bold">Hang 'n Go</span>" range: LaundryDome, Laundry Cave, and Laundry Hood! The range is designed to fit different needs and environments depending on space availability in your yard, balcony, patio, or garden. Whatever option you choose, they all have one thing in common: saving energy, reducing costs, and supporting a greener planet.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:-Introducing-LaundryDomeTM-">
<span class="bold">Introducing</span> <span class="bold">LaundryDome™</span>
</h3><p>The benefits of drying laundry outdoors using a rotary washing line are well documented - especially when compared to using a tumble dryer. It's cheaper and more environmentally friendly. The sun's ultraviolet rays kill off germs and bacteria and leave your laundry smelling and feeling fresh. The problem is: what happens when it rains? <span class="bold">LaundryDome™ </span>is designed to solve this problem. </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="47523287">

<p>Harnessing natural heat and airflow, this rotary drying canopy speeds up drying while protecting clothes from unexpected rain. A new type of rotary washing line umbrella, it attaches to your *<span class="text-italic">existing</span> rotary washing line to protect your washing from the rain. Using only the power of Nature, it allows you to continue drying your laundry <span class="bold">even when it rains</span>! What's more, it dries your washing quickly and with <span class="bold">zero energy cost!</span></p><p>After several prototypes, the design is now moving to the final stage prior to production. It has a patent pending and is pretty much ready to launch. In order to take the product into production and launch it properly, though, I need to raise some initial funding. </p><p>Based on early feedback, I propose to launch <span class="bold">LaundryDome™ </span> in <span class="bold">one universal size</span> to keep things simple and efficient for the initial production run. This size will be compatible with most square rotary clothes airers. A rib length of 160cm covers a typical square rotary airer up to 175 cm x 175 cm, making it a versatile solution for a wide range of households. I will continue to assess demand and consider expanding with additional sizes based on your feedback.</p><p>*I'm proposing to sell LaundryDome mainly as an umbrella that attaches to your <span class="text-italic">existing</span> rotary washing line. However, for people who don't currently have their own rotary washing line, I will also offer the option to include a rotary washing line. This option will be known as the <span class="bold">LaundryDome COMBO</span>.</p><p>Designed to reduce our impact on the planet, I believe this eco-friendly device has the potential to significantly reduce consumers' energy costs by reducing the use of energy-hungry electric tumble dryers - and consequently CO2 emissions. What's more, I believe it will also save money!</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:So-Just-How-Much-Can-LaundryDomeTM-Save-You-"><span class="bold">So, Just How Much Can LaundryDome™ Save You?</span></h3><p>Well, I want to be careful not to exaggerate or make unsubstantiated claims. So, probably best if I just refer you to a couple of independent sources which explain the cost of running a tumble dryer. </p><p>First, <span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">The Energy Trust</span></span> says tumble dryers, along with washing machines and dishwashers, account for a huge 14% of households' energy usage. Some dryers can cost as much as £1.76 a cycle, which adds up pretty quickly over time. </p><p>Also, <span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">Ideal Home Magazine </span></span>says a vented tumble dryer can cost £1.34 per cycle and £159 per year on average.  </p><p>So you can do the math yourself! I think investing in a <span class="bold">LaundryDome™</span> for many people should pay back very quickly. Just think how much money you could save over the years to come. </p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Overview-How-does-it-work-"><span class="bold">Overview - How does it work?</span></h3>
<p><span class="bold">LaundryDome™ </span>attaches easily to the shaft of most rotary washing lines using our specially designed universal adjustable clamp. Its UV-stabilized, clear, vented canopy keeps your laundry dry during rain while allowing moisture to escape. It keeps the rain off your laundry, freeing up your time.</p><p>An optional, detachable side curtain (see below image) enhances drying efficiency by creating a greenhouse effect, capturing the sun’s heat to warm the air inside.  </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="45995795">

<p>This warm air removes moisture from your wet clothes, escaping through the overlapping canopy vents or condensing on the inner surface of the side curtain, thus speeding up the drying process.  </p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Key-Benefits-"><span class="bold">Key Benefits!</span></h3><ul>

But I'm showing them as they demonstrate the development of the product so far. Enjoy looking through!</p><p>First of all, here is an image of one of my early prototypes, which served as a proof of concept. You can see how effectively the <span class="bold">LaundryDome</span> extracts moisture from the laundry. Take a look at the amount of condensation on the inner surface!  </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="First prototype of the LaundryDome" data-caption="" data-id="45995853">

<p>The condensation dripped to the ground, but I realised that the overlapping canopy vents were sticking to each other. By improving ventilation, I could allow more of the moisture to escape through the vent panels. </p><p>The next images show some early design concepts of the universal clamp, which we later prototyped and tested.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="48741857">

<p>Above is a rendering of a rib connection, which I had 3D printed. Its purpose is not only to provide strength but also to raise the ribs of the upper canopy from the lower canopy. This creates a wider vent opening to increase the airflow. Furthermore, the rib is inserted through sleeves, creating a surface area that catches the wind. Potentially, depending on weather conditions, I'm trying to design a structure that will cause the clothes to move through the air, aiding the drying process still further.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="Laundry Dome prototype rotary clothes line airer umbrella, shown here with optional heat-trap side curtain attached." data-caption="" data-id="45994089">

<p>The above image shows a later prototype utilising the new 3D printed rib connectors and with raised canopy sleeves. When we move to production, I'll probably reduce the length of the optional side curtain such that it hangs about 10cm above the ground. This should help improve the air circulation.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="Prototype of LaundryDome rotary washing line umbrella, shown here without optional side curtain attached.

<p>LaundryDome revolutionises laundry drying with a rotary design that harnesses rising heat and vented airflow for faster, energy-free drying—rain or shine!</p><p>With the side curtain attached, I have tested the temperature underneath the canopy and found it to be significantly warmer, depending on weather conditions. In the testing I have carried out to date, it definitely seems to speed up the drying of your wet laundry. Once the finished product is available, I aim to submit the product for independent testing.</p>
<p>With your support, I aim to continue improving this new approach to outdoor laundry drying. I have ideas to develop the concept and experiment with solar-powered fans, for example, to optimise air circulation within the canopy.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Other-Products-in-the-Hang-n-Go-Range-Laundry-Cave-Laundry-Hood-"><span class="bold">Other Products in the "Hang 'n Go!" Range - Laundry Cave &amp; Laundry Hood!</span></h3><p>A rotary washing line is not practical for everyone's situation. And so I've designed two other products in our <span class="bold">Hang 'n Go</span> eco-friendly laundry drying range. These use exactly the same approach to trapping the heat of the sun and creating air circulation currents.</p><p>These are the <span class="bold">Laundry Cave</span> and the <span class="bold">Laundry Hood</span>.</p><ul><li>
<span class="bold">LaundryCave</span> - is a modular drying unit perfect for compact outdoor spaces like balconies or patios. It's a self-assembly, arch-shaped structure big enough to fit a clothes horse/drying rack inside. It can be used freestanding or preferably screwed to the wall to make it stable in the wind. Made from a UV-stabilised clear fabric and fibreglass rods, it protects your laundry from the rain. It has ventilation panels in the roof and mesh door panel to allow various ventilation options.  It's also modular - if one's not big enough, you can attach a second (or third!) to increase the depth and the number of clothes airers contained within.</li></ul><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="47470965">

I have worked extremely hard to make this product ready for Kickstarter and full-scale manufacturing. I'm confident in our ability to produce our product at quality in mass and fulfil all our perks on time. However, things don’t always go as planned. Here are a few of the risks that may come up, and our plan to address them: 

MANUFACTURING: 
I have a trusted manufacturer lined up and will have quality assurance people on-site during production. Despite this, in my experience, manufacturing delays can still happen. Whether it’s an unexpected backlog, bad timing with holidays, or a quality assurance issue on the ground floor, I will let you know immediately. Our #1 priority is product quality followed by timely delivery. 

DESIGN:
Note: the images show the latest prototypes - it's still possible that the eventual finished product may differ. There are some details about the final design that I'm still finalising.

FULFILLMENT: 
Sometimes, stuff happens that can’t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a package gets held up at customs, a shipment gets lost, or a global pandemic shuts down shipping ports around the world. Those things can cause delays. I am using an experienced logistics team to get our products to you. I’ll keep open and honest communication with you through our process so you know where your product is and when it’s going to get to you.</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-commitments" id="environmentalCommitments"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Environmental commitments</h2><span><span class="ksr-green-700">Visit our Environmental Resources Center</span> to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.</span></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Long-lasting design</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">LaundryDome™ will use durable materials to maximize its lifespan.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Reusability and recyclability</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">LaundryDome™ will use minimal packaging.

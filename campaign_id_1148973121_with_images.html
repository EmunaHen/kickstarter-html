The point: lowering barriers to exploration, experimentation, and symbolic gesture to the planet’s most inaccessible region.</p><p>This expedition is for sending a memento, a prototype, or a question into the abyss.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Environmental-Footprint"><span class="bold">Environmental Footprint</span></h3><p>The world's oceans are under pressure from many dimensions. <span class="bold">This project will not  be one of them.</span> There is a responsible way to explore the depths, and our approach represents an exploratory approach driven by a first principle <span class="bold">leave no trace</span>. We emphasize that this is a round trip for your objects to provide exposure without impact to the wider Mariana Trench environment. This is not deep sea mining and is not even making ground contact with the sea floor. This transit is entirely within the water column of the ocean above Sirena Deep. With the exception of cremated remains, your objects will encounter pressure and sea water while leaving nothing behind. </p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:-Deeper-Why"><span class="bold"> Deeper Why</span></h3><p><span class="bold">The Initial Why: </span></p><p>Curiosity. When presented with the idea, the primary question is: what would happen if I sent XYZ 10,000 meters down? </p><p>Deep sea exploration is surrounded by a deep aura of mystery and inaccessibility. This is warranted because the subject matter is a larger unknown than even space travel, with perhaps 26% of the worlds seafloor being mapped as of 2025 with much of this arriving through key projects in the last several decades. Additionally, most deep sea exploration is built around sophisticated remote operating vehicles ROVs that can complete limited range dives.</p><p>We have an idea of how to answer this question, but the answer comes through experience. </p><p><span class="bold">The Long Term Why: </span></p><p>This project exists to make the deep sea accessible for the curious, the inventive, and those with research and concepts that are impractical until a standardized commercial transit service exists. </p><p>Our cost structure is heavily indexed towards the fixed costs of creating the expedition in the first place while the Descent Locker approach allows for a rapid and repeatable deployment, minimizing variable costs and thus making each additional descent increasingly economical. </p><p>The vision here is to make the world's deeps as accessible to exploration and research as space has become through volume and regular safe and responsible commercial service. With regular descents powered by your curiosity, we can empower less obvious rationales just to name a few:</p><ul>
<li>🤿 Submersible and ROV manufacturers can incorporate a 10,000M depth testing into a standard check procedure at a reasonable cost because infrastructure is already in place</li>
<li>👕 Clothing manufacturers can incorporate a high pressure stage into creation of novel forms</li>
<li>🍋 High pressure lemon processing allows for Limoncello that exceeds all expectations</li>
<li>⚗️ High pressure allows at-scale blending of immiscible ingredients that cannot normally be blended</li>
<li>🌍 Environmental monitoring sensors can be placed and checked at regular intervals along the trench and beyond</li>
<li>🧬 Artificial skin can be applied evenly into complex mesh structures on full sized humanoid robotic forms </li>
</ul><p>The core premise of this project is to build a reliable, economical, and sustainable system for transit to deep ocean destinations so that more exploration can be done without the fabulously high budgets required to build custom submarines every time. It begins with the most acute and obvious curiosities and matures in the manner of a Jevons Paradox. The parallel here is express air shipping, which was phenomenally expensive when it first emerged as a category. Now it's not just a convenience but a critical component of many industries. </p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:How-the-Descent-Works"><span class="bold">How the Descent Works</span></h3><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Technical-Specifications"><span class="bold">Technical Specifications</span></h4><p><br/>This project offers backers an accessible method to transport objects of their choosing from their location to 6 miles under the Mariana Trench 33,000ft or 10,000M down - and return shipping back from there. </p><p>You are reading this correctly. </p><p>This is a round trip descent and ascent of your objects. Individual items are organized by volume and will be secured in place using a system of smaller lockers secured into a larger frame called the descent locker. This arrangement allows us to arrange items as needed to deliver a target buoyancy to achieve the necessary tension to maintain our target descent speed range. </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Raw immersion - foam cups are particularly impacted by the pressure at depth" data-id="49853228">

<p>Different objects will be handled differently by type. There are four key categorizations that are your choice as part of the expedition:</p><p><span class="bold">Raw immersion - </span>these are items that will experience full pressure and interaction with sea water. They would not dissipate and filter outside of the locker or mesh bags under pressure. <span class="bold">Examples: foam cups, surfboards, watches, jewelry, clothing, leather</span></p><p><span class="bold">Pressurized contact - </span>these objects will be sealed in a seawater containing bladder. They will be exposed to the full pressure of the voyage, but the objects themselves will not make direct seawater contact with the water available at 10,000M depth. <span class="bold">Examples: rice, lemons, camera film, soda can, tea, coffee, rum.</span> These can be prepared in seawater in sealed formats to force high pressure seawater exposure, but will not be directly exposed to the sub sea water column.</p><p><span class="bold">Isolated descent - </span>these are objects that will remain at constant 1 atm pressure throughout the entirety of the descent using a spherical pressure chamber. <span class="bold">Examples: watches that are going down exclusively as mementos or delicate sensors that require deep-sea isolation placement to function properly</span> and would otherwise be destroyed by the pressure of the depths. The specific cost of depth-only drops will need to be customized to your item particulars, so please reach out if this format is of interest.</p><p><span class="bold">Cremated remains</span> - our mission is to respect the deep by leaving no trace, but cremated remains are the sole exception to this. These ashes are primarily calcium phosphates with trace other elements that do not contain organic matter which could disrupt benthic ecosystems through microbial activity. Cremated remains are screened to be dry, granular, and chemically inert such that they do not decompose further or introduce toxins into marine environments. To minimize radius further, the remains will be released with a specialized urn designed to release contents at 10,000M depth. These contents cannot contain objects other than ash and require specific permitting which we will arrange as part of this offering. <br/><br/> </p><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Purchased-Materials">Purchased Materials</h4><p>This project is designed to utilize existing infrastructure and off the shelf components for as much as possible.

</ul><h4 class="page-anchor" id="h:Cost-Structure"><span class="bold">Cost Structure</span></h4><p>The total cost of operating this expedition is approximately $120,000 USD. This Kickstarter’s funding goal of $25,000 is an initial milestone. This is not the full budget. It represents a proof-of-concept benchmark to initiate equipment orders and secure the expedition window. This target reflects the minimum interest required to proceed with full infrastructure build out.</p><p>Breakdown of major project costs:</p><ul>

The waters of the Mariana Trench are nearby and dedicated as a US National Marine Monument. The specific target of this expedition will be the Sirena Deep located at 12°3.924′N 144°34.868′E, which has a maximum depth of 35,151ft or 10,714M. The Mariana Trench is a large structure, extending for 1,560 miles / 2,550km with an average width of 43 miles / 69km. The Sirena Deep is a profoundly unexplored location with only one recorded descent by a human as part of the Five Deeps Expedition, which was an inspiration for this project that both mapped the sea floor and helped make this possible.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49839894">

<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:When"><span class="bold">When</span></h3><p><br/>This expedition is targeted to run to completion by the end of October 2025 across multiple days until all descents are completed. The weather across the Mariana Trench is often very challenging for expeditions. As with everything in the open ocean, weather conditions will dictate reality. Typhoon season runs June to November, but weather in the trench region becomes more challenging by October - hence why the expedition is slated to be completed by that time. </p><p>Travel to the Sirena Deep from Guam will take 2-4 hours under clear conditions.</p><p>Once there, each descent is expected to take 2-4 hours down, hold 1 hour at depth, then take 2-4 hours for the return ascent. This means that each descent takes one day in real terms. The expedition will continue descents daily while weather permits with a potential need to return to port if weather conditions become a risk. </p><p>Our full operational timeline is detailed below. As the Kickstarter closes in July, purchase commitments will be the first to begin with rope and winch manufacturers as these are the longest lead time items. Our chartered vessel will also be secured for the exact timing and capacity needed. </p><p>Shipments from mainland US locations will be consolidated in Los Angeles in August and air shipped to Guam later in the month. Additional welding and fabrication of the Descent Locker will be completed once these items are received.

Everything we’re doing here has been done before, but only at price points suited to governments or elite institutions.</p><p>I believe the most powerful outcomes emerge when mystery becomes known method.

We have minimized avoidable risks without over-indexing on investments before demand is successfully proven out. That's where Kickstarter comes in. If this project is funded, it means there is more than sufficient interest in universalizing access to the bottom of the ocean with a substantial margin of safety. 

Core risks:
1. Weather. This is both a risk for timing and a risk for realization. Safety of crew and cargo is paramount in this expedition and will be the decisive factor in all questions throughout the project. Typical challenging weather has been built into the project schedule but will absolutely delay the project if this becomes atypical. We will post regular updates if challenges are known or encountered. 
2. The Descent Locker will be descending blind using bathymetry maps in a known location. The Sirena Deep is kilometers wide, which allows plenty of range but no adjustments are possible throughout the descent / ascent period.
3. Tangled line. The winch design for this application is not complex nor unknown, but requires testing and reliable operation. All 6 miles of line will be extended under tension, but ocean currents and twist in the line can compound coiling risks. This is a risk that is expected and can be managed through proper winch design. 
4. Item loss. This project is operating in profoundly new territory, which presents a real possibility of total item loss. Items of great sentimental value are not recommended to be sent in the first iteration of descents in 2025 unless you are personally accompanying the voyage and are comfortable with the risk real time. Risk will be staged by performing test descents before performing the primary descents of the project. 
5. Marine Cargo Insurance. Loss and damage to items is a meaningful risk and not possible to accurately account for in a blanket format for all backer offerings. Sub-sea transport is not included in standard marine cargo insurance, but is available at cost for items of value. While we manage for all known risks, this will need to be accounted for on a case by case basis until insurance carriers have an understanding of project operating risk level. 

Peripheral managed risks:
1. The Sirena deep portion of the Mariana Trench lies in US Marine Monument waters. This is a good thing for clarity of permitting authority, which allows the project to operate in the water column of a US Marine Monument. Additional permitting is in process, but still needed for release of cremated remains. 
2. Physical reality. This descent strategy has not yet been executed nor implemented. While we have outlined and created a resolution plan for all known challenges, there are always unexpected issues that arise from the physical world. The Sirena Deep has been visited one time by a single human in all of known time. Its bathymetry has been mapped thanks to this expedition and it is known to be a particularly favorable destination for this project. 
3. Weather. Typhoon season intersects with good weather season in Guam, which means a strong weather event could delay the ultimate implementation schedule.</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-commitments" id="environmentalCommitments"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Environmental commitments</h2><span><span class="ksr-green-700">Visit our Environmental Resources Center</span> to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.</span></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Something else</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">Fathomdeep is committed to leaving no trace behind in the Mariana Trench. The descent vessel is designed to be fully self-contained and returned to the surface in the same condition. 

All objects included in descents will be securely housed in lockers or mesh bags to be exposed to the deep sea environment, but without the ability to exit the descent vessel. A different solution will be provided for objects that contain liquids or material that may exude into the water column, a sealed pressure bladder containing sea water will be arranged at surface level before descent such that the pressure at depth can be expressed without a loss of material. 

There will be one exception to this: a burial at sea. 

The delivery of ashes to the ocean’s deepest region represents a profound act of remembrance.  When the full depth of the descent is reached, ashes will be released from a depth triggered container latch while a video feed is recorded of this release.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span>Questions about this project? </span><span class="bold link-blue type-16">Check out the FAQ</span></div></div><div id="report-this-project"><span class="kds-button kds-button">Report this project to Kickstarter</span></div></div>

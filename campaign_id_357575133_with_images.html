Meanwhile, listeners assume their subscriptions help the artists they care about… but they don’t. The current system pools revenue and redistributes it in ways that prioritize business over artist, not direct connection. </p><p>This isn’t about any one company — it’s a structural misalignment.</p><p>Artists aren’t compensated fairly, and listeners aren’t given the tools to directly support what resonates with them. Everyone’s participating in a system that doesn’t reflect their values. </p><p><span class="bold">Solution</span> </p><p>Pulse is a streaming and discovery platform that pays artists more, values listener attention differently, and fosters genuine connection between both.</p><p>We started by asking: What would a fair system actually look like if we rebuilt it from scratch? </p><p><span class="bold">Here’s what makes Pulse different:</span> </p><ul>
<li>Direct, Scaled Payouts<br/>As Pulse grows, artist payouts grow — directly. Instead of a giant pool where money disappears, we use a user-centric model where your subscription or listening time translates into real support for the artists you engage with.</li>
<li>Ethical Discovery<br/>Our discovery algorithm is shaped by emotional resonance, not engagement farming. You won’t be force-fed viral trends. You’ll hear more of what you love — and you’ll know your interaction matters.</li>
<li>A Calmer Platform<br/>Pulse is designed to feel different. No ads, no algorithmic chaos, no hidden incentives. Just music, fairly delivered, with clarity baked into every interaction. </li>
</ul><p><span class="bold">Project Story</span></p><p>Pulse started as a systems question: What’s really broken here, and how do we fix it without just repackaging it? </p><p>I’d seen friends build real momentum as independent artists — gain thousands of streams, excited fans, promising traction — only to receive royalty checks that didn’t even cover groceries. I’d talked to listeners who genuinely believed they were helping their favorite musicians by streaming more. They weren’t wrong to believe it — the system was wrong to obscure it. </p><p>So I built Pulse to bring integrity back into the equation. It’s not a protest. It’s a plan.

Every innovative project comes with challenges, and we believe in facing them with transparency and a steady hand. Here are the key risks and how we plan to address them:

•	Scaling the Platform: Building a music streaming platform that can handle millions of plays and users is a serious technical undertaking. We need robust servers, and a seamless app experience. Mitigation: Our tech team has experience in building scalable apps, and we’re starting with a focused beta to ensure stability before expanding. We’ll invest in proven streaming infrastructure and optimize as we grow gradually, rather than rushing to scale overnight.
•	User Adoption &amp; Network Effect: Convincing artists and listeners to join a new platform is challenging in a world dominated by a few big players. Pulse’s value grows as more people use it, so early adoption is critical. Mitigation: We’re addressing this by partnering with independent artist communities and early adopter listeners who are passionate about our mission. By seeding Pulse with great content from committed artists (who often bring along their fanbases), we create an initial ecosystem that attracts others. We’ll also communicate clearly to listeners that using Pulse isn’t an all-or-nothing choice – they can enjoy it alongside other services initially, easing the transition.
•	Financial Sustainability: Our model aims to pay artists a much larger share, which means we operate on thinner margins than typical services. Running a streaming platform (bandwidth, development, support) isn’t cheap, so sustainability is a key concern. Mitigation: We have a lean business plan that keeps costs low (for example, no lavish executive bonuses or expensive offices). We’re exploring additional ethical revenue streams like optional listener tips or sponsorships that don’t compromise our values. The Kickstarter funding itself is part of ensuring we build a solid base to grow from. In short, we are balancing generosity with pragmatism: as we scale up, economies of scale will help, and we’ll always prioritize fair payouts as a non-negotiable expense in our model.
•	Technology &amp; Implementation: Introducing a new payout system and platform means unexpected bugs or hurdles can arise (from payment processing to app compatibility). Mitigation: We are approaching development methodically. We’ll focus on building prototypes and conducting tests to catch issues early. Post-Kickstarter, we plan a phased rollout: first to backers and a small test group, to gather feedback and fix issues, then to a wider audience. This staged approach allows us to solve technical challenges on a smaller scale before they become big problems. We’re committed to open communication; if something isn’t working perfectly, you’ll hear it from us along with how we plan to fix it.

We understand that changing an industry won’t happen overnight. However, we are prepared for the long journey. Our ethos is to remain calm, focused, and transparent no matter what challenges arise. Every risk is being managed with the same ethical clarity that defines Pulse as a whole. By backing us, you’re not betting on reckless hype – you’re supporting a thoughtful, carefully built movement that acknowledges the hurdles and is ready to meet them head on.</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-commitments" id="environmentalCommitments"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Environmental commitments</h2><span><span class="ksr-green-700">Visit our Environmental Resources Center</span> to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.</span></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Something else</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">Pulse Music is a digital-first platform.

Wherever I went, my loyal companion, my best friend and soul mate was at my side ready for the next adventure. Winston Bones was a free spirit with an independent mind, a Hound Dog through and through. I rescued him from the Humane Society in Vero Beach, FL where I grew up. I was a mere kid, and he was 7 months of crazy puppy. He was one of nine Hounds confiscated from the home of a hunter in the woods who kept them locked up in small crates outside in the blazing sun or the pouring rain, neglected and starving. <br/><br/>In our home, Winston was a wild man, boss dog with no boundaries. He ruled the house, and I let him. Fast forward to six years later on one sunny Santa Barbara day, I met a dog trainer and an animal rescuer doing a demonstration on training at the local pet store. Oh, you can actually lead your dog rather than them leading you. What a concept! Out the window went the make-up and thus began my career in dog rescue and rehabilitation. Thirteen years later, maybe 600 dogs rescued, rehabilitated and re-homed, I’m delving into the world of entrepreneurship in the form of training tools. While Winston passed on to a more beautiful land July of 2022 at the ripe age of seventeen, his memory lives on in our hearts, our souls, and in the lives we continue to save. <br/><br/>This brand is dedicated to him. This tool has proven so essential and has assisted me in saving the lives of many a rescue dog. I use it for threshold boundaries (amazing to keep dogs safe!), leash training, aggressive jumping on people, and crucially, for dog reactivity. With dog reactivity, the sudden spray in front of their line of vision, (not directly in their face), and the uncomfortable smell of the citronella, (not appealing to dogs), breaks their focus prior to the dog reacting. The handler is then able to guide the dog’s attention back to them and reward them for good behavior. A lot of the time, foster dogs enter a new home, and they don’t know you from Adam. Sometimes, they are flight risks wanting to charge the gate or door. Sometimes they’re reactive to humans or other dogs from having been in a shelter for too long. Teaching a dog not to rush the door/gate is of the utmost importance! Canine Connect’s Spray It Don’t Say It! is a great tool for this. A little spray goes a long way to teaching the dog to back away from the “exit” and learn only to go through when the human says it is safe. The human can then reward the dog, (think treats, pets!), rewarding and reinforcing the good behavior. <br/><br/>Why is our product different than the others on the market, you ask? First off, think environment! We are sourcing recyclable materials and eliminating as much plastic as possible. No one-time use individual plastic shells! Each 2 oz bottle of Spray It Don’t Say It! contains a BOV (bag-on-valve) eco-pouch. These are modern and eco-friendly alternatives to conventional spray cans. BOV has a longer shelf life and does not contain toxic elements capable of causing adverse environmental contamination. With the use of this BOV system, we have eliminated the need for CO2, a harmful greenhouse gas. This, along with the replacement of Ethanol, (used by other dog citronella sprays), with Coco-Glucoside, a coconut-based surfactant, makes it a friendlier version for the dogs as well. There is no heat sensitivity, thus very limited fear of explosion with added pressure. This eliminates the need for shipping in plastic shells. Our shipping materials will be compostable/recyclable, and we aim to use plantable seed paper for our marketing pamphlets. Train your dog, grow your garden. Saving lives, educating dog owners and making a difference in the world we live in are our aspirations, with a minimal carbon footprint left behind. Our next move will be to expand our brand to other dog essentials with a focus on sustainability and clean, safe ingredients. <br/><br/>WARNING:  Our product is safe for most dogs, but not recommended for puppies. Some dogs who experience reactions or skin sensitivity, as well as certain dog breeds, such as French Bulldogs and Pugs, may be more sensitive to it. Although it is a highly diluted amount and we are being very mindful of all components, it certainly is not intended for ingestion or skin use. We of course will have a warning label and instructions once we have the final product.<br/><br/>Thankful to all who support this and all of the animal lovers out there giving a beautiful  life to their furry family members. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks" id="risks-and-challenges"><h2 class="normal mb4">Risks and challenges</h2><p class="js-risks-text text-preline">The biggest risk is keeping our costs low while sourcing the best quality, eco-friendly components. We are having to invest in 50,000 actuators, even though our first order of product will be 5,000. This was the best quality actuator that provided our desired spray stream, but unfortunately has a high MOQ. It will only push us harder to succeed.</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-commitments" id="environmentalCommitments"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Environmental commitments</h2><span><span class="ksr-green-700">Visit our Environmental Resources Center</span> to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.</span></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Reusability and recyclability</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">We are utilizing more recyclable elements than the available citronella products on the market, and eliminating as much plastic as possible. We have chosen a B.O.V. (bag on valve) system, eliminating the need for one-time use plastic shells of individual bottles, as the BOV system eliminates oxidation and ensures product stability. It is the most environmentally friendly aerosol system, “the green alternative to standard aerosols.” It is 100% recyclable. It eliminates the need for CO2 use, a harmful greenhouse gas. The spray will include a metal side clip for attaching to your belt or bag, as opposed to plastic.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Sustainable materials</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">We aim to use seed paper for the marketing pamphlets. Train your dog, grow your garden. The BOV system also increases the dispensability of the product. While our product is .4 oz less, the amount of sprays per can is actually greater.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Environmentally friendly factories</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">We have chosen Above Aerosol Labs as our manufacturing company, as they specialize in the bag on valve system and strive to create clean, chemical-free products. Their system is basically waste-free, ensuring that 99.5% of the product is utilized. They offer “eco-friendly— no ozone, no pollutants, fully recyclable can[s].”</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Sustainable Distribution</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">Because of the BOV system, we aim to eliminate the individual plastic shells required by the Department of Transportation for shipping purposes.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span>Questions about this project? </span><span class="bold link-blue type-16">Check out the FAQ</span></div></div><div id="report-this-project"><span class="kds-button kds-button">Report this project to Kickstarter</span></div></div>

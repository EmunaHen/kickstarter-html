<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Drive-Stories-is-an-audio-app-that-intelligently-plays-you-stories-about-the-area-around-you-"><span class="bold">Drive Stories is an audio app that intelligently plays you stories about the area around you.</span></h3><p>Drive Stories is a passionate return to the open road and the driving experience, helping unlock location stories from all around the world - allowing us to create enjoyable moments of open-road freedom and a leading example of how technology can help unlock knowledge and information in an exciting new way.</p><p>The idea for the app was inspired by traveling in various locations around the world and wondering about the story of the places we were driving through. Maybe we saw old historical towns and wondered about it's past and the people that came from it, or saw deserted factories and wondered, 'what type of industry was here in the past?', or drove through beautiful natural landscapes and thought 'what types of wildlife are in those hills?', or saw amazing buildings in a new city and asked 'I wonder about the architectural history and influence here?'. The list goes on.</p><p>What we found is that information on locations (specifically information about cities, villages, towns, etc) around the world IS available, but the way to tap into it is cumbersome, complicated, un-curated and requires sifting through hundreds of confusing Google search results. It's simply not easily accessible while driving, as a passenger, or even walking around a city.</p><p>We're done with the head-down-in-phone thing while the world passes us by. We want to be present, windows down, music on, enjoying (and learning) about what's around us. The world is outside our window, and we want to know about it.</p><p>What we've created with Drive Stories is a hyper-easy, on-demand and intuitive interface to access and enjoy all of this phenomenal data in an incredibly easy way : <span class="bold">just hit 'play' and drive and listen.

<p>As we've prototyped and built the app, our excitement has grown over using Drive Stories as a frequent resource and companion on drives (we're even using it while walking around cities). It becomes a quick audio reference and storytelling resource when you're curious about the area you're in. We're excited to hear how you use it and all the ways we can continue to grow and refine the experience. </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49383854">

<p><br/><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">“Because Renters Deserve the Truth!”</span></span></p><p><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">Created by: </span></span>Evan Guy</p><p>There’s no simple way to check if a landlord is responsive, honest, or even safe to deal with. You’re expected to sign a lease, often worth tens of thousands of dollars, based on little more than a gut feeling.</p><p><span class="bold">Rate My Landlord </span>changes that.</p><p>It’s a web and mobile app where renters can rate, review, and warn others; just like they would for a restaurant, Uber driver, or Airbnb host. It’s anonymous, secure, and long overdue.</p><p><br/><span class="bold">TL;DR / Summary</span></p><p>I’m building an app called Rate My Landlord, a mobile and web platform where renters can rate and review their landlords. It’s inspired by how we already rate Uber drivers, professors, and restaurants—but right now, there’s no reliable way to check if a landlord is honest, responsive, or even safe to rent from.</p><p>This app will change that.</p><p>Renters will be able to leave star ratings, write reviews, upload photos (like repairs that weren’t fixed), and link to Zillow listings to give context. Users can search landlords by name or area code, and everything can be done anonymously.</p><p>The project is fully in progress. I’m building it myself using Flutter (so it works on iOS, Android, and web) and Firebase (for secure login, database, and image storage). I’ve already written key parts of the code, including review submission, area code filtering, and photo upload features. The design is modern, clean, and intentionally simple, made to be accessible for renters of all ages.</p><p>Right now, I’m looking for $5,000 - $10,000 in support from friends and family to help with app store fees, legal protection (terms of service, privacy policy), final testing, and a modest launch campaign (including ads and outreach to college renters and housing forums).</p><p>This is a lean, focused, high-impact app that fills a very real gap. Renters are already talking about their landlord experiences. It's time they had a proper place to do it. If you’ve ever had a bad landlord, you know how much a tool like this could help. If you’re interested in backing a project that’s being built with care and purpose, I’d love to tell you more below! <br/><br/><span class="bold">What's It For?</span></p><ul>
<li>Search for landlords by name or area code</li>
<li>Leave 1-5 star reviews for landlords or tenants alike</li>
<li>Upload photos of the unit or issues</li>
<li>Link to the property’s Zillow listing</li>
<li>Read other tenants’ experiences</li>
<li>Use the app anonymously or join the community with a free profile</li>
<li>Choose from clean, modern UI themes</li>
</ul><p>It will work across Android, iOS, and web, all from one codebase.</p><p><span class="bold">Why does this Matter?</span></p><p>There’s no real way to research a landlord before you move in.</p><p>People rely on word of mouth, Reddit threads, or just luck. And when things go wrong, there’s no way to warn the next person.</p><p>We rate restaurants, drivers, and even professors. But not landlords? That doesn’t make sense.</p><p>This is a tool that renters clearly need, want and frankly surprisingly does not exist yet!</p><p><span class="bold">Where I’m At</span></p><p>I’m building this myself as a solo developer using Flutter (for cross-platform development) and Firebase (for authentication, real-time database, and image storage).</p><p>Progress so far:</p><ul>
<li>Core functionality is in development<br/> </li>
<li>Auth, review submission, and image uploads are being tested<br/> </li>
<li>UI is designed to be clean, modern, and renter-friendly<br/> </li>
</ul><p><span class="text-italic"> Here’s a peek at some of the actual code that’s already working: </span><span>CLICK HERE</span></p><p><span class="bold">Estimated Expenses Breakdown </span></p><p>To launch this publicly and safely, I would need to ask for $5,000–$10,000 from  friends, family, and colleagues. Here’s what that will help cover:           </p><p><span class="text-italic"><span class="bold">ExpenseEstimate</span></span></p><p>App Store &amp; Play Store fees.                     $ 150                 </p><p>Legal protections (TOS, Privacy).      $1,500</p><p>QA Testing &amp; Polish                             $1,000</p><p>Marketing (ads, creator promo).        $2,500</p><p>Emergency support &amp; ops.                 $850</p><p>And I’m keeping costs minimal. No team, no overhead. Just me, the code, and some tactical marketing.</p><p><span class="bold">Why This Matters</span></p><p>Because where you live affects everything: your safety, your mental health, your finances, your sense of control over your life. And yet, renters are expected to make one of the biggest decisions of their year, sometimes their lives based on zero information about the person who owns the property.</p><p>You don’t know if your landlord is going to fix things. You don’t know if they’ll respect your privacy. You don’t know if you’re walking into a nightmare. All you see is clean photos, staged furniture, and maybe a smiling leasing agent.</p><p>That’s the reality for millions of people. And when something goes wrong and it often does there’s no real way to hold anyone accountable or warn the next renter.</p><p>This app matters because it gives people a voice where they’ve never had one. It gives renters a way to protect each other.</p><p>It puts pressure on landlords to do better. It takes what’s always been a private struggle and makes it visible.</p><p>Rate My Landlord is about trust. It’s about the truth. It’s about giving renters a tool they’ve needed forever and building a little bit of balance into a system that’s been one-sided for far too long.</p><p>If you’ve ever rented a place and felt powerless, disrespected, or trapped, then you already know why this matters. This is how we start fixing that.</p><p><span class="bold">Why I’m Sharing This</span></p><p>I’m sharing this because I’m working on something I believe has real value and I’d love your support getting it off the ground.</p><p>Rate My Landlord is an app I’m developing that gives renters a simple, secure way to rate and review their landlords. It’s something I haven’t seen done well, and it fills a gap a lot of people have experienced firsthand.</p><p>This project has been a great challenge and an exciting step forward for me as a developer. I’m building it using Flutter and Firebase, which means it’ll work across iOS, Android, and web. </p><p>I’ve already made solid progress on key features like review submission, area code filtering, photo uploads, and user authentication. </p><p>What I’m working toward now is turning this from a strong work-in-progress into a real product, something I can put in people’s hands. That means handling the launch side of things: app store fees, legal basics, testing, and a small rollout campaign to start getting users.</p><p>I’m sharing this with people I trust not because I’m asking for a handout, but because I know how far support from people who believe in you can go. If you’re able and willing to back what I’m building even a little it would mean a lot. And if not, just having your encouragement is valuable, too.</p><p><span class="bold">Launch Timeline</span></p><p>Since I’m building this solo while working full-time, I’ve created a realistic, focused timeline that lets me move steadily without sacrificing quality. I’m committing 6–12 hours a week, and I’m aiming for a public launch in early 2026 with a fully polished app for both web and mobile.</p><p><span class="bold">Here’s the breakdown:</span></p><ul><li><span class="bold">Planning &amp; Design (Weeks 1–3)</span></li></ul><p>I’ll lock in the final feature set, finalize UI designs, secure the domain and name, and set up branding and social handles.</p><ul><li><span class="bold">Development Setup (Weeks 4–7)</span></li></ul><p>This phase is about getting the project structured, integrating Firebase, and wiring up basic user authentication and navigation across platforms.</p><ul><li><span class="bold">Core Feature Development (Weeks 8–12)</span></li></ul><p>I’ll build out the main functionality: landlord search, area code filtering, review submission, ratings, and display—all tied securely into Firebase.</p><ul><li><span class="bold">Media + Theming (Weeks 13–16) </span></li></ul><p>This is where the app gets polished. I’ll integrate photo uploads, add visual themes (dark mode, etc.), and clean up the UI for a consistent cross-platform experience.</p><ul><li><span class="bold">Testing &amp; Beta Feedback (Weeks 17–19)</span></li></ul><p>I’ll do thorough internal testing, then invite a small beta group for real-world feedback. I’ll use that to patch bugs and tighten up the UX.</p><ul><li><span class="bold">Launch Prep (Weeks 20–26)</span></li></ul><p>This includes app store submissions, legal documents (TOS, privacy policy), and preparing the website and social channels for launch. I’ll also do light outreach and early marketing.</p><p>I’ve paced this to be sustainable but focused, so I can deliver a well-built, trustworthy product without rushing. The app is scoped realistically and designed to go live in Q1 2026 with full web and mobile support.<br/> </p><p><span class="bold">Send Off</span> </p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this and consider what I’m working on. Whether you’re able to support the project financially or not, just knowing you’re interested in what I’m building means a lot.</p><p>I’m excited about where this could go, and I’m doing everything I can to make it something real, useful, and impactful. If you choose to support it, I’ll make sure your trust is respected, your support is valued, and you’re kept in the loop every step of the way</p><p> -  Evan Guy </p><p><br/> </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49188673">

While there’s healthy debate around AI in creative and tech spaces, I’m using it responsibly as a tool, not a replacement for real work or judgment.
That said, development as a one-person team has its challenges timelines can shift, and moderation of user-generated content is always a moving target. I’m addressing this with smart safeguards, clear community rules, and transparency every step of the way. App Store compliance is also part of the plan from day one.

Our <span class="bold">STEM in Motorsports program</span> is designed to prepare middle and high school students for real-world careers in engineering, physics, design, marketing, and more—by letting them experience the excitement of competitive racing from the classroom.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:High-School-Program-Real-Racing-Real-Roles-Real-Results">High School Program: Real Racing, Real Roles, Real Results</h3><p>We’re launching a full-scale STEM racing initiative for high schools that will run through a network of <span class="bold">arrive-and-drive sim racing centers</span>, along with schools that receive their own simulators. These are not just driving games—students will form full-fledged <span class="bold">sim racing teams</span>, taking on roles such as:</p><p><span class="bold">Drivers</span></p><p><span class="bold">Mechanical Engineers</span></p><p><span class="bold">Aerodynamics Specialists</span></p><p><span class="bold">Race Strategists (Mathematicians)</span></p><p><span class="bold">Team Managers</span></p><p><span class="bold">Marketing &amp; Sponsorship Coordinators</span></p><p>Each school will be assigned a virtual car and a racetrack. For one month, their teams will engineer, test, and perfect their vehicle and strategy. Then, they’ll <span class="bold">compete head-to-head online with other high schools across North America</span>. Our long-term goal is to help these students transition into <span class="bold">Formula SAE college racing programs</span> and STEM-based collegiate scholarships.</p><h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:Middle-School-Program-Where-Curiosity-Meets-Competition">Middle School Program: Where Curiosity Meets Competition</h3><p>To support this pipeline of future talent, we’ve developed a middle school program centered around the <span class="bold">Kyosho Mini-Z RC Car platform</span>—chosen for its perfect balance of speed, drivability, and technical depth. These 1/28th scale cars offer a world of engineering learning, with adjustable:</p><p>Ride Height</p><p>Suspension Stiffness</p><p>Camber &amp; Toe Angles</p><p>Gear Ratios</p><p>RWD vs AWD configurations</p><p>Custom liveries (paint jobs) for team identity</p><p>The racing happens on <span class="bold">modular RCP foam tracks</span>, which snap together like a puzzle. Kids learn more than just driving—they learn <span class="bold">discipline, responsibility, and teamwork.</span> Each session, they’re responsible for setting up and storing the track.

While we're confident in the success of this program, here are a few challenges we’re prepared to navigate:

School Adoption Timing: School approval processes can be slow, and some districts may take longer to join. We’re addressing this by starting with schools already in discussions and hosting live demos to accelerate adoption.

Shipping &amp; Fulfillment: RC cars, tracks, and tools come from multiple vendors. We’ve pre-identified reliable suppliers and will bulk-order kits early to prevent delays.

Student Engagement: Keeping students engaged long-term requires good structure. That’s why we’ve built a full curriculum with monthly racing goals, rotating team roles, and competition between schools.

Track Maintenance &amp; Care: Track wear can impact race quality. We teach students to maintain their equipment and include spare pieces in each kit for replacements.

We’ve been testing these ideas for years and have the infrastructure and partners in place. Your support will help us scale responsibly and give students an unforgettable STEM experience.</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div><div><div class="pt8"><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-commitments" id="environmentalCommitments"><div class="mb6"><h2 class="normal mb1">Environmental commitments</h2><span><span class="ksr-green-700">Visit our Environmental Resources Center</span> to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.</span></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Long-lasting design</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">How will you maximize the life of what you’re making?
We’re designing this program to be sustainable, modular, and upgradeable—maximizing both longevity and educational value.

Durable Equipment: The Kyosho Mini-Z cars and RCP Tracks were chosen because of their proven durability in club and competitive environments. These are not toys—they're performance-grade and built to last with proper care.

Modular Components: Every kit includes spare parts, tuning tools, and easily replaceable components so students can repair and maintain their own vehicles. We teach maintenance as part of the curriculum—giving the equipment a longer life while teaching real-world responsibility.

Reusable Tracks: The RCP foam track system is modular, so layouts can be changed monthly, keeping engagement high while preserving the material. Teams are trained to set up and store tracks properly, protecting the equipment and instilling team discipline.

Scalable Curriculum: The program grows with the students. The same kits can be used year after year by new teams with updated goals, projects, and competitions—making it a multi-year investment for schools, not a one-time activity.

Connection to High School Programs: These middle school kits are designed to feed directly into our high school sim racing programs, helping schools build long-term STEM pipelines with reusable assets.

By teaching care, maintenance, and reuse, we're ensuring this investment makes an impact well beyond year one.</p></div><div class="js-commitment-category mb2 border-bottom border-grey"><h3>Reusability and recyclability</h3><p class="mb2 text-preline">Sustainability is baked into every stage of this program—from packaging to long-term use.

Minimal &amp; Reusable Packaging: All kits will be delivered in durable, reusable storage bins rather than disposable cardboard boxes. These bins double as the club’s long-term equipment lockers, helping schools stay organized while eliminating single-use waste.

Modular, Repairable Gear: Every RC car and track component is designed to be maintained, not thrown away. Students will learn how to repair, tune, and replace individual parts—preventing full replacements and extending the lifespan of every piece.

Recycle-Friendly Materials: Any unavoidable packaging will be sourced from recyclable materials whenever possible, and we’re working with vendors that share our sustainability goals.

Curriculum That Teaches Stewardship: A core part of the program is teaching students to care for their equipment—emphasizing the impact of waste and the importance of sustainability in engineering and racing.

By combining reusable containers, teachable care practices, and repairable systems, we’re building a program that stays out of the landfill—and in the classroom—for years to come.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span>Questions about this project? </span><span class="bold link-blue type-16">Check out the FAQ</span></div></div><div id="report-this-project"><span class="kds-button kds-button">Report this project to Kickstarter</span></div></div>

<h3 class="page-anchor" id="h:The-basic-system">The basic system</h3><p>Here is how it basically works, sombody as a problem that they can't solve alone and set it on the app :</p><ul>
<li>1- Somebody needs help and they post their request on the app, it can be anything like helping to move out, just having a conversation like friend for 1 hour or even helping to paint a wall.</li>
<li>2- It will go through the <span class="bold">7-step AI algorithm</span> analyzes the task to determine the difficulty of the missions, it will give the rank needed for the missions, the XP given, identifies required skills and also a recommendation for the client for a fair price. </li>
<li>3- The quest proposition is then proposed at a certain rank, and the users can either propose themselves for the missions if they have a good enough rank or they can take a test with the IA if their level is close enough.</li>
<li>4- If the missions are done successfully, the user will get <span class="bold">money and XP! </span>If he fails, at completing the missions he will not get the money nor the XP and will get <span class="bold">penalty points</span> ranging from XP downgrade to temporary ban from accepting missions of your rank.</li>
</ul><p>Obviously the is more specifications and details on every point, but it would be too long to explain here. But basically the more you complete, the more you will unlock <span class="bold">higher-ranked quests </span>with higher rewards. We ensure that anyone can <span class="bold">progress, learn, and grow </span>safely and with us. </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="Examples of users missions on the interface (everything is subject to change and this is clearly just for illustration purposes only)" data-id="48860372">

<p>If we talk about S rank missions, only companies can offer such quests, they required a real level of qualifications. Reaching the rank S allows you a real credibility in the job market. You really show your determination and your skills by attaining the rank S, it is not an easy thing but if you do you deserve recognition. If you do have the rank S in some skills you will become eligible for <span class="bold">official certification, </span>that we will easier finance for you or straightly deliver to you. The base goal of Levelink is about giving everybody a chance to prove their <span class="bold">skills, to evolve, and to becoming the best version of themselves</span>.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="User interface exemple (everything is subject to change and this is clearly just for illustration purposes only)" data-id="48860379">

I love my OBS truck, but its original radio felt like a relic from another era. The crackling static, the limitations of cassette tapes, and the complete lack of modern features like Bluetooth were a constant reminder that my classic ride deserved better. I envisioned a radio that seamlessly blended into the factory dash while offering all the tech I enjoyed in newer vehicles. This wasn't just about an upgrade it was about preserving the timeless aesthetic of the OBS interior. It began with a simple design focusing on the core functionality. My initial steps were purely conceptual. I spent hours staring at my truck's dashboard, taking measurements, and poring over diagrams of the original radio to understand its exact dimensions and mounting points. I knew the key was to create something that looked OEM not a clunky aftermarket add-on. The very first "prototype" was simply a hand-drawn sketch over a photo of the OBS dash. I mapped out where the screen would go, how big it could be while keeping the classic feel. This quickly evolved into 100s of 3d printed prototypes allowing me to visualize the fit and assess ergonomics from the driver's seat. It was a humble beginning, but these early, rough iterations were crucial for solidifying the vision of a custom OEM style touchscreen radio that truly honored the OBS look.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49872791">

<p>The first 3D printed prototype was a game-changer. Suddenly, I had a physical piece that I could snap into the dashboard. This allowed for real-world testing of the fitment confirming the measurements, the mounting hole locations for screws, and how flush it sat against the dash. More importantly, this tangible model opened up a direct channel for feedback. I shared images and even a short video of this 3D-printed prototype within various OBS TRUCK Communities on Facebook Their enthusiastic response was immediate, but a consistent piece of advice emerged: "Can the screen be bigger?"</p><p>This feedback from the OBS community was instrumental. While my initial design prioritized maintaining the factory look absolutely, owners were willing to accept a slightly larger screen if it meant a better user experience, as long as the OEM aesthetic wasn't compromised. Armed with this invaluable insight, I went back to the CAD drawing board, carefully pushing the boundaries of the screen size within the existing radio opening, ensuring it still appeared stock. The next prototype of the radio would embody this improvement, moving me closer to the ideal custom OEM-style touchscreen radio.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49872895">

<p>It was time to transition from prototypes to a real, production-ready part. This meant moving beyond home 3D printing to professional manufacturing processes that could replicate the OEM quality I was striving for. The next critical step involved investing in tooling and injection molding. This is where the digital CAD files were transformed into robust steel molds, designed to precisely form each radio bezel and component from durable, automotive-grade plastics. But the exterior was only half the story. To truly integrate modern functionality while ensuring reliability and a perfect fit, I also made a significant investment in custom motherboard design and manufacturing. This meant designing a Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA) specifically for this radio, optimizing every component and connection to fit within the constrained OEM dimensions while delivering cutting-edge performance. This wasn't just another prototype it was the final product, built to withstand the daily use in OBS trucks for years to come, ready for mass production and ready to redefine the driving experience for enthusiasts everywhere.</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49873058">

<p> I'm now raising funds to finalize production and bring this dream project to fellow OBS enthusiasts like you.<br/>What We're Funding<br/>Your contributions will directly fuel the final stages of the OBS Link project. Specifically, the funds will be used to:<br/>* Upgrade Key Components: We're enhancing the heat sink and finalizing the design of a custom motherboard to ensure optimal performance and reliability.<br/>* Introduce a New Color Option: We'll be adding a sleek grey color option to better match a wider range of OBS interiors.<br/>* Kickstart Production: The majority of the funds will cover the initial production costs for the OBS Link units, allowing us to move from prototypes to a finished product. This includes tooling, manufacturing, and covering the costs associated with initial pre-orders.<br/>Why This Project Matters to Me<br/>My journey with OBS trucks began after a buying my first 1989 Ford Mustang 5.0 at 17 years old i invested all my money on it and it constantly failed on me this taught me the value of reliability, my mom would see me struggle with the car and decided to help me get a reliable car. I always seen the OBS trucks on magazines and video and after months of convincing her the truck is the most reliable option, she helped me get my first 1989 Silverado short bed single cab 5.7 brown exterior, MINT PeanutButter interior color for 3k I still think of that truck often. That initial drive, cruising at 9 PM with the moon-style cluster and manual windows, cemented my love for these vehicles. Since then, I've been dedicated to OBS trucks, working on restoring the interiors all over California and custom repair parts. my garage is mainly for OBS trucks! I have a lot of products coming out including kids' clothes, family matching outfits, OEM style seat belts and much more to come!!<br/>Like many of you, I was always bothered by how aftermarket single-DIN radios disrupted the classic look of the dashboard. I envisioned a touchscreen that fit precisely in the original location. This personal quest led to countless hours, over 100 3D-printed prototypes, and two years of tireless dedication to develop the OBS Link. This isn't just about a radio it's about preserving these trucks while giving them the modern functionality they deserve, without sacrificing that original charm. I know many in the OBS community share this appreciation for authenticity, and my goal is to deliver a product that truly resonates with that sentiment.<br/>Our Plan to Make It Happen<br/>Our immediate focus is on securing the necessary funds through pre-order sales. Once these initial sales targets are met, we'll be able to cover the remaining development costs and initiate full-scale production. This will allow us to:<br/>* Fulfill Pre-Orders: Get the OBS Link units into the hands of our early supporters.<br/>* Offer to the General Public: Make the OBS Link widely available to all OBS truck owners.<br/>* Continue Innovation: The success of the OBS Link will enable me to continue developing and customizing other parts for these trucks. I already have exciting projects in the pipeline, including OEM-style color-matched seatbelts and switch bezels. Some of you may have even seen my previous repair parts, like the highly sought-after cluster and dashboard swap adapter for 88-92 to 93-94 clusters.<br/> </p><p>About Me<br/>My name is Brandon, and I'm from Los Angeles CA. My passion for customizing cars and trucks started young – I practically grew up taking them apart (and sometimes messing them up!). My journey into the world of OBS trucks began unexpectedly but has since become a driving force. I've personally invested a significant amount of time, effort, and my own money into the OBS Link, fueled by a genuine love for these vehicles and a desire to create solutions that truly enhance the owner experience. With your help, we can bring the OBS Link to production and continue to innovate for the OBS community. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT!   OBS THE WORLD! 🌎</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="49873320">

The primary consideration I've built into our plan is the shipping and delivery timeline.
The only significant risk I'm actively managing is potential delays in production or shipping. While I'm confident in our suppliers and manufacturing process, unforeseen issues – like supply chain disruptions, unexpected quality control needs, or logistical hiccups – can sometimes push schedules back.
How I'm Overcoming It:
To address this, I've deliberately exaggerated our estimated shipping time to give us ample room for any unexpected issues. My internal goal is to have the OBS Link units delivered by the second month after production begins. However, to provide a realistic and safe expectation, I've added an extra month to that estimate, meaning you should anticipate delivery by the third month. This buffer ensures that even if minor setbacks occur, we can still meet or even beat our communicated deadline, providing a smoother experience for everyone.
My commitment is to transparent and frequent communication. Should any significant delays arise, you'll be the first to know.</p><span class="ksr-green-700 bold type-16">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</span></div></div></div></div><div class="border-bottom mb4 mb9-md"><div class="mb9 type-16"><span>Questions about this project? </span><span class="bold link-blue type-16">Check out the FAQ</span></div></div><div id="report-this-project"><span class="kds-button kds-button">Report this project to Kickstarter</span></div></div>
